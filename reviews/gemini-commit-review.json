If the downstream TTS provider has a strict character limit, this could lead to failures for very long sentences. Consider either:\n\n1.  Throwing an `HttpError` if any single sentence from `splitIntoSentences` exceeds `MAX_TEXT_LENGTH_CHAR_COUNT`.\n2.  Implementing a sub-splitting mechanism for such long sentences within the `characterCount` logic to ensure no single chunk exceeds the limit. This would require more complex logic than simple sentence splitting based on punctuation.",
