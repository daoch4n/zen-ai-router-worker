This is a critical fix as unescaped curly braces in f-strings would cause a `ValueError` or incorrect parsing, preventing the model from receiving the correct JSON schema. This ensures the prompt is correctly formatted for Gemini's structured output feature.",

Previously, `head_sha` would remain `None` for push events, potentially limiting the effectiveness of the `repo.compare` strategy. This makes the diff retrieval more robust across different event types.",
