While the comment suggests further handling, it's generally safer and clearer to perform explicit model mapping (e.g., from Claude 3 Opus to `gemini-1.5-pro`) within this transformer if the downstream system expects specific OpenAI or Gemini model identifiers. Relying on implicit mapping elsewhere can lead to unexpected behavior if not consistently applied. Consider adding a lookup table or a dedicated mapping function here.",

The `tool_use_id` is an internal identifier from the assistant's previous `tool_use` message. To correctly map this, you would need to either: 1) track the `tool_use_id` to tool name mapping from previous assistant messages (more complex, requires state) or 2) infer the tool name from the `tools` definition provided in the request, assuming the `tool_use_id` somehow correlates to a known tool.

If `delta.function_call.name` is always present in the first `function_call` delta (which is common for OpenAI), then the `name` is correctly set in the `content_block_start` on line 79. The `accumulatedToolArguments` is initialized to an empty string on line 87, making the condition `!this.accumulatedToolArguments[this.currentToolUseId]` always true for the first `function_call` delta. Since the block is empty, it serves no purpose and can be removed to improve clarity and maintainability.
