This can lead to incorrect status reporting in the summary comment, as `used_fallback_key` might remain `True` even if the primary key is currently active and functional after a full rotation cycle. Consider resetting this flag in the `else` block where `self.current_key` is set back to `self.primary_key`.\n\n```python\n            else:\n                logger.warning(\"All available API keys are rate limited or unavailable.

Calling it in the `finally` block is sufficient, as it guarantees the timeout is cleared regardless of whether the promise resolves successfully or rejects.

However, the current implementation, which builds a `binaryString` using `+= String.fromCharCode(bytes[i])` in a loop, can be inefficient for very large `ArrayBuffer` inputs. Repeated string concatenation can lead to performance degradation and increased memory usage. While `btoa` itself is efficient, the string preparation step could be a bottleneck for extremely large audio files. For typical audio chunk sizes, this might be acceptable, but for very large buffers, consider alternatives if performance becomes an issue.",

The `fetch` function now correctly accepts `event` and it is passed to `handleRawTTS`.\n\nPlease ensure that `handleRawTTS` correctly utilizes both `env` and `event` (which typically represents the `ExecutionContext` in Cloudflare Workers). Specifically, if `handleRawTTS` interacts with Durable Objects or performs asynchronous operations that need to extend the lifetime of the request, `event.waitUntil()` should be used.\n\nExample (conceptual, assuming `handleRawTTS` can access `event`):\n```javascript\nasync function handleRawTTS(request, env, event, apiKey) {\n  // ...\n  const durableObjectId = env.TTS_JOB_DO.idFromName(\"some-job-id\");\n  const durableObjectStub = env.TTS_JOB_DO.get(durableObjectId);\n\n  // If an async operation needs to complete after the response is sent\n  event.waitUntil(durableObjectStub.someAsyncOperation());\n  // ...\n}\n```",

If decoding a specific audio chunk fails (e.g., due to corrupted data), the error will propagate to the outer `try...catch` block in `initiateTtsRequest`, which will stop the entire chunk fetching loop. This means subsequent valid chunks won't be processed or played.\n\nConsider wrapping the `decodeAudioData` call in its own `try...catch` block within `processAudioChunk`. If decoding fails, you can mark that specific segment as failed (e.g., `segment.classList.add('failed')`) and log the error, but allow the `initiateTtsRequest` loop to continue fetching and processing other chunks.
