This is generally not recommended in transformation functions, as it can lead to unexpected side effects if `anthropicReq` is used elsewhere after this function call.\n\nSince `openAIReq` is being constructed as a new object, simply omitting the `thinking` property when building `openAIReq` is sufficient to prevent it from being passed to Gemini. The explicit deletion from the original `anthropicReq` is unnecessary for the purpose of this transformation.\n\nConsider removing this line to avoid modifying the input object:\n\n```javascript\n// 11. Thinking (Ignored by Gemini, ensure it's not passed)\n// No action needed if anthropicReq.thinking is present, as it's not added to openAIReq\n// if (anthropicReq.thinking !== undefined) {\n//   delete anthropicReq.thinking; // Remove this line\n// }\n```",
