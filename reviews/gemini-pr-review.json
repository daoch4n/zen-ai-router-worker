      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: High**\n\nThe mapping of `block.tool_use_id` to the `name` field within `functionResponse` is incorrect for Gemini.\n\nAnthropic's `tool_use_id` is an internal identifier for a specific tool call instance, not the actual name of the function that was called. Gemini's `functionResponse.name` expects the *declared function name* that the model originally invoked (e.g., `\"get_weather\"`).\n\nThis will likely lead to errors in the Gemini API if it validates the `functionResponse.name` against the `functionDeclarations` provided in the request. The proxy needs to maintain state to map the `tool_use_id` (from the `tool_use` block in the assistant's previous message) to the actual `name` of the function that was called. Without this, the `functionResponse` will be malformed.\n\n**Suggestion:**\nConsider how to persist the mapping between Anthropic's `tool_use_id` and the actual function `name` when an `assistant` message with `tool_use` is processed. This mapping would then be retrieved when a `user` message with `tool_result` arrives. If state management is not feasible within this stateless transformer, this is a significant limitation that should be clearly documented, as it breaks core function calling functionality for `tool_result` messages.\n\nExample (conceptual, requires state):\n```javascript\n// When processing assistant's tool_use message:\n// store.set(block.tool_use_id, block.name); // Store mapping\n\n// When processing user's tool_result message:\n// const functionName = store.get(block.tool_use_id); // Retrieve actual function name\n// geminiMessage.parts.push({\n//   functionResponse: {\n//     name: functionName, // Use the actual function name\n//     response: { result: block.content }\n//   }\n// });\n```",

      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: Medium**\n\nThe comment `// TODO: Implement usage reporting if Gemini provides it in stream` might be misleading. The current implementation in `transform` and `emitMessageDelta` *does* attempt to capture and report `geminiChunk.usageMetadata` if it's present in the stream (typically in the final chunk). If Gemini only provides usage in the final chunk, the current approach is correct. If Gemini can stream usage deltas, then the TODO is accurate, and the current implementation would need to accumulate those deltas. Consider clarifying or removing the TODO if the current approach is deemed sufficient for how Gemini streams usage.",

      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: Low**\n\nThe `console.warn(\"Received functionCall args fragment but no active tool call to assign it to:\", fc);` is a good defensive measure. This scenario could indicate a malformed stream from Gemini or an unexpected ordering of `functionCall` parts (e.g., args without a preceding name or `lastActiveToolCallIdForArgs` being reset prematurely). While not a bug in this transformer, it's worth noting as a potential edge case that might need further investigation if it occurs frequently in logs.",

      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: High**\n\nThe mapping of Anthropic `tool_result` to Gemini `functionResponse` seems to have a critical flaw in how the `name` field is populated. Gemini's `functionResponse.name` must be the actual function name (e.g., `get_weather`), not the Anthropic `tool_use_id` (e.g., `toolu_123`). The `tool_use_id` is an identifier for a specific *call instance*, not the function's declared name.\n\nSending `name: \"toolu_123\"` to Gemini will likely result in an error because \"toolu_123\" is not a declared function. The transformer needs to either maintain state to infer the original function name from the preceding `assistant` message's `tool_use` block, or the `tool_result` in the Anthropic request would need to include the original function name.\n\n**Suggestion:** Ensure `functionResponse.name` is populated with the actual function name (e.g., `run_query` from the `assistant` message in this test case) rather than the `tool_use_id`.",

If Anthropic's `tool_result.content` is `{ success: true, data: \"result_data\" }`, then Gemini's `response` should likely be `{ success: true, data: \"result_data\" }`, not wrapped in an additional `result` key like `{ result: { success: true, data: \"result_data\" } }`.\n\n**Suggestion:** Verify the exact schema for Gemini's `functionResponse.response` and adjust the mapping to avoid the extra `result` wrapper if it's not required or intended.",

Anthropic's `tool_choice` types are `auto`, `any`, and `tool` (with a name).\n\nIf the intention is to test how the transformer handles scenarios where function calling should be explicitly disabled (Gemini's `mode: \"NONE\"`), please ensure this is based on a valid Anthropic input or an inferred condition (e.g., if `tools` array is empty and no `tool_choice` is provided, or a custom extension).\n\n**Suggestion:** Re-evaluate this test case. If Anthropic doesn't support `type: \"none\"`, this test should be removed or adapted to reflect a valid way to achieve `NONE` mode in Gemini based on Anthropic's capabilities or the transformer's specific logic for inferring `NONE`.",

If the intended behavior is for `tool_config` to be entirely omitted when no tools are present and no explicit `tool_choice` is given, then a direct assertion like `assert.strictEqual(geminiReq.tool_config, undefined)` would be clearer and more robust. The `assert.ok(true, ...)` always passes and doesn't verify the actual state.\n\n**Suggestion:** Clarify the intended behavior for `tool_config` when no tools are present and simplify the assertion to directly reflect that expectation.",
