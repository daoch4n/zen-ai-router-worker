While `handleTtsChunk` correctly uses `/retrieve-chunk` for individual chunk retrieval, this `/retrieve` endpoint could potentially lead to high memory consumption and slow responses within the Durable Object if a TTS job consists of a very large number of small chunks. If this endpoint is not intended for client-facing retrieval of all audio data at once, consider adding documentation or a warning about its potential performance implications for very large jobs. If it is intended for such use, further optimization (e.g., pagination or streaming from the DO) might be necessary for scalability.",

This means that after the first update, the job data will persist indefinitely unless explicitly deleted, overriding the initial TTL.\n\nTo ensure the TTL is maintained, you should either fetch the existing `expirationTtl` from the stored `jobData` (if you store it as part of `jobData`) or re-apply the `TTL_SECONDS` constant when calling `this.storage.put()` in these update functions.\n\nExample for `handleUpdateStatus`:\n```javascript\n// ...\njobData.status = status;\n// Assuming TTL_SECONDS is accessible or jobData stores its original TTL\nawait this.storage.put(jobId, jobData, { expirationTtl: TTL_SECONDS });\n// ...\n```",

However, other error responses (e.g., invalid JSON body, invalid jobId format) return JSON with a `Content-Type: application/json` header.\n\nFor API consistency, all error responses should ideally follow the same format (e.g., JSON). This makes it easier for clients to parse and handle errors uniformly.\n\nConsider changing these responses to:\n```javascript\nreturn new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Job not found' }), {\n  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n  status: 404,\n});\n```",

If the TTS output can exceed this size, `this.storage.put(jobId, jobData)` will fail.\n\nFor larger audio results, consider storing them in a separate, more suitable storage service like Cloudflare R2 or S3, and only store a reference (e.g., a URL) to the audio file within the Durable Object's state. This decouples large binary data from the DO's state management.\n\nIf you intend to keep it in DO storage, you might need to add a size check before storing or ensure robust error handling for potential storage limit exceptions.",

Hardcoding them assumes that the Google TTS API will *always* return audio in this specific format, regardless of the input model or voice configurations. If the API ever changes its default format, or if different voice parameters lead to different audio encodings/sample rates, this hardcoding will result in incorrect `Content-Type` headers and potentially unplayable audio.\n\n**Suggestion:** Revert to extracting `mimeType` from `part.inlineData` as it was before, and re-use the `parseSampleRate` function.\n\n```javascript\n// In callGoogleTTSAPI:\n// Before:\n// const hardcodedMimeType = 'audio/L16;rate=24000';\n// const hardcodedSampleRate = 24000;\n// After:\nconst { data: base64Audio, mimeType } = part.inlineData;\nconst sampleRate = parseSampleRate(mimeType); // Re-use the existing parseSampleRate function\n\nreturn {\n  base64Audio,\n  mimeType, // Use the extracted mimeType\n  sampleRate, // Use the extracted sampleRate\n  orchestratorTimeoutMs: timeoutMs\n};\n```",

This mismatch will cause the playback progress bar to be incorrectly positioned on the page.\n\nTo fix this, you should either:\n1.  Make `playbackProgressBarContainer` a child of `overallProgressBarContainer` in the HTML, and then position it absolutely with `left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;` within `overallProgressBarContainer`. The `playbackProgressBar` inside it would then be dynamically sized to overlay the `currentSegment`.\n2.  If `playbackProgressBarContainer` must remain a sibling, its `left` and `top` calculations need to account for the `overallProgressBarContainer`'s position relative to the common `container` parent. For example, `playbackProgressBarContainer.style.left = `${overallProgressBarContainer.offsetLeft + currentSegment.offsetLeft}px`;` (and similar for `top`), assuming `overallProgressBarContainer` is also positioned relative to `container`.",
