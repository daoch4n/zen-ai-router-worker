For consistency and robustness, it should attempt to extract `mimeType` from the `data` object received in the 200 response (e.g., `data.mimeType`) before defaulting, similar to how `_callBackendTtsService` handles it for direct 200 responses. This ensures that if the backend provides a more specific or different MIME type, it is correctly propagated.",

      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: High**\n\nThe retry logic within `_callBackendTtsService` currently retries on *any* non-OK HTTP status code (`!response.ok`). This includes non-transient client-side errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden). Retrying these types of errors is generally unproductive as they are unlikely to resolve on retry and can waste resources. Consider refining the retry condition to only retry on specific transient error codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests, 5xx Server Errors) and fail immediately for other non-retryable errors. This aligns with the improved error handling in `_pollForTtsResult`.",

      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: High**\n\nThe `handleRawTTS` function call has been updated to pass `env` and `event` as new arguments. This suggests that `handleRawTTS` now requires access to the environment (likely for Durable Object bindings or other resources) and potentially the `event` object (e.g., for `event.waitUntil()` to ensure background tasks complete). Please ensure that the implementation of `handleRawTTS` has been updated accordingly to accept and correctly utilize these new parameters, especially if it's now initiating asynchronous operations that should not block the response but must be guaranteed to finish.",
