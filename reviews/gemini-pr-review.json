While the new orchestrator flow correctly uses `/retrieve-chunk` for individual chunk retrieval, this `/retrieve` endpoint itself could still lead to high memory consumption and slow responses within the Durable Object if a TTS job consists of a very large number of small chunks and this endpoint is directly invoked. Consider if this endpoint is strictly necessary to return *all* chunks at once, or if it should be refactored to return only metadata, or implement pagination/streaming if it's intended for client-facing retrieval of large amounts of data.",

For a job that might be picked up by an external worker, it's often more semantically accurate to start in a `'queued'` state before transitioning to `'processing'`. Consider initializing the job with `status: 'queued'` for better state machine consistency.\n\n```javascript\nconst jobData = {\n  jobId,\n  text,\n  model,\n  voiceId,\n  status: 'queued', // Change from 'processing'\n  result: null,\n  createdAt: Date.now(),\n};\n```",

This is because the spread operator (`...`) attempts to pass all elements of the `Uint8Array` as arguments to `String.fromCharCode` at once, which has a limit.\n\nFor robust handling of potentially large binary data, consider an iterative approach or a more specialized utility function for Base64 encoding. A common pattern to avoid this issue in environments like Cloudflare Workers is to build the binary string iteratively:\n\n```javascript\nasync handleGetResult(jobId) {\n  // ... existing code ...\n\n  // Convert R2 Object Body to ArrayBuffer\n  const arrayBuffer = await r2Object.arrayBuffer();\n\n  // Encode to Base64 (more robust for large files)\n  let binary = '';\n  const bytes = new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer);\n  const len = bytes.byteLength;\n  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n    binary += String.fromCharCode(bytes[i]);\n  }\n  const base64Audio = btoa(binary);\n\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ jobId, status: jobData.status, base64Audio, mimeType: jobData.mimeType }), {\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    status: 200,\n  });\n  // ... rest of the code ...\n}\n```",

While the destructuring `const { base64Audio, mimeType } = await jobResultResponse.json();` correctly extracts `base64Audio`, the subsequent call to `processAudioDataJSONResponse` still uses the undefined variable `audioContentBase64`.

This was raised in a previous review comment. Hardcoding these values assumes the Google TTS API will always return audio in this specific format, which is a fragile assumption. It can lead to incorrect `Content-Type` headers and unplayable audio if the API's default format changes or if different voice parameters result in different audio encodings/sample rates. Please revert to extracting `mimeType` from `part.inlineData` and re-using the `parseSampleRate` function as suggested previously. This ensures the response accurately reflects the actual audio format from the API.",

If `handleRawTTS` is initiating asynchronous operations, such as creating or interacting with the `TtsJobDurableObject` to process a TTS job, it's crucial to ensure that these operations are properly awaited or kept alive using `event.waitUntil()`.

This will cause the sort to fail (resulting in `NaN` comparisons) and the audio chunks to be concatenated in an arbitrary, likely incorrect, order, leading to garbled or incorrect final audio.\n\nTo fix this, ensure that `fullAudioBuffers` stores objects that include the `index`:\n\n```javascript\n// In processAudioChunk:\nfullAudioBuffers.push({ buffer, index: currentChunkIndex });\n```",

This value should ideally be used consistently for the dynamic timeout calculation for all subsequent `/api/tts-chunk` requests.\n\nCurrently, you are retrieving it from `chunkData?.orchestratorTimeoutMs || 0;`:\n\n```javascript\nconst orchestratorDynamicTimeout = chunkData?.orchestratorTimeoutMs || 0;\n```\n\nThis implies that `orchestratorTimeoutMs` is expected to be present in every chunk response, or defaults to 0 if `chunkData` is null (e.g., on the first chunk or if a chunk fetch fails). While the `+ 20000` buffer provides a fallback, it would be more robust to store the `orchestratorTimeoutMs` received from the *initial* `tts-initiate` response in `window.ttsJobData` or a similar scope, and then use that stored value for all subsequent chunk requests. This ensures the timeout is consistently applied based on the orchestrator's recommendation for the entire job.",
