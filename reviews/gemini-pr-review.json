      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: High**\n\nThe implementation for handling `functionCall` parts in the `transform` method (lines 106-140) appears to force sequential processing of tool calls, rather than supporting parallel tool calls as stated in the Pull Request description (\"Supports parallel function calls from Gemini, mapping them to multiple `tool_use` blocks\").\n\nSpecifically, when a new `functionCall` with a `name` is encountered (`if (fc.name && !existingToolIdWithName)`), the code iterates through `this.activeToolCalls` and calls `emitContentBlockStop` for any currently `isStarted` tool calls, effectively closing them before starting the new one. This means only one `tool_use` block can be active and receiving `input_json_delta` fragments at any given time.\n\nIf Gemini's streaming format for parallel tool calls involves interleaving `functionCall` parts for different tools (e.g., `toolA` name, `toolB` name, `toolA` args, `toolB` args), or providing multiple `functionCall` objects in a single `parts` array within a chunk, the current logic will prematurely stop previous tool calls. This could lead to incomplete tool call arguments or incorrect `stop_reason` if a tool call is stopped mid-stream.\n\nPlease clarify how Gemini streams parallel function calls. If true parallel streaming (where multiple `tool_use` blocks are open concurrently) is intended, the logic needs to be revised to allow multiple entries in `this.activeToolCalls` to remain `isStarted` and to correctly route `fc.args` fragments to their respective tool calls without closing others. This would likely require Gemini to provide an identifier for each parallel function call in its stream deltas, which is not typical for current Gemini streaming `functionCall` parts.\n\nConsider if the \"parallel function calls\" support mentioned in the PR description applies only to the non-streaming response transformation, or if the streaming behavior needs to be re-evaluated based on Gemini's actual streaming capabilities for parallel tool calls.",

      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: Medium**\n\nIn the `should correctly transform a pure text-only stream from Gemini` test, the assertion for `input_tokens` in the `message_start` event is `assert.ok(events[0].data.message.usage.input_tokens > 0, \"Input tokens should be estimated\");`.\n\nIf the `promptTokenCount` from Gemini's `usageMetadata` (which is `3` in the final chunk of this test) is intended to be the source for Anthropic's `input_tokens` in `message_start`, then a more precise assertion like `assert.strictEqual(events[0].data.message.usage.input_tokens, 3);` might be more appropriate. \n\nIf the `input_tokens` in `message_start` is indeed an estimation based on the `mockOriginalRequest`'s content, then the current assertion is acceptable. However, it's good to be explicit about whether it's an estimation or a direct mapping from a known value.",
