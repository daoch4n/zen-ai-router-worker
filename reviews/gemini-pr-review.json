The `model` parameter, which is passed into `_callBackendTtsService` from `handleRawTTS` and `handleTtsInitiate`, is ignored. This means that users attempting to specify a different TTS model via the API will always get the default model, which is a functional bug.\n\n**Suggestion:** Replace `DEFAULT_TTS_MODEL` with the `model` parameter in the `_callBackendTtsService` function's request body.\n\n```javascript\n// In _callBackendTtsService, change:\nbody: JSON.stringify({\n    text: text.trim(),\n    model: DEFAULT_TTS_MODEL, // <-- This should be 'model' parameter\n    voiceId: voiceId\n}),\n// To:\nbody: JSON.stringify({\n    text: text.trim(),\n    model: model, // Use the 'model' parameter passed to the function\n    voiceId: voiceId\n}),\n```",

This code is from a previous iteration and is no longer relevant as `voiceId` is now correctly passed in the request body. Keeping commented-out, irrelevant code can cause confusion for future developers.\n\n**Suggestion:** Remove these commented-out lines to improve code clarity:\n\n```javascript\n// Remove these lines:\n// backendTtsUrl.pathname = '/api/rawtts'; // Corrected path for backend worker\n// // Pass voiceId as voiceName in URL query parameters\n// backendTtsUrl.searchParams.set('voiceName', voiceId);\n// // Clear other search parameters if needed, or explicitly set only required ones\n// // backendTtsUrl.search = `voiceName=${encodeURIComponent(voiceId)}`;\n```",

This effectively makes the key manager thread-safe, preventing race conditions when multiple threads concurrently access or modify the API key state.

In a multi-threaded environment, `Client.configure` modifies a global state, and concurrent calls could lead to API requests being made with an incorrect or overwritten API key. This lock ensures that only one thread configures the client or initiates an API call at a time, guaranteeing consistent API key usage and preventing unexpected behavior.",

While you've addressed this for encoding with `arrayBufferToBase64`, a similar robust utility function for decoding (e.g., `base64ToArrayBuffer`) would make this operation more resilient to large audio files.

If two concurrent requests attempt to update the same `jobId` (e.g., one updates status, another stores result), one update might overwrite the other, leading to a lost update.\n\nTo ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions, especially in Durable Objects, it's best to use `this.storage.transaction()` for critical state modifications. This guarantees that the read, modify, and write operations are treated as a single atomic unit.\n\nExample for `handleUpdateStatus`:\n```javascript\nawait this.storage.transaction(async txn => {\n  const jobData = await txn.get(jobId);\n  if (!jobData) {\n    // Throw an error or return a specific response to be caught outside the transaction\n    throw new Error('Job not found'); \n  }\n  jobData.status = status;\n  await txn.put(jobId, jobData, { expirationTtl: this.TTL_SECONDS });\n});\n// Return success response outside the transaction block\n```\nApply this transactional pattern to `handleStoreResult` as well.",

This was a high-severity issue raised in a previous review. Hardcoding these values makes the API response brittle and can lead to incorrect `Content-Type` headers or unplayable audio if the Google TTS API's default format changes.

This addresses the first part of the previous review comment regarding the availability of these objects for asynchronous operations. However, to fully address the previous comment, please ensure that `handleRawTTS` (located in `src/handlers/index.mjs`) properly utilizes `event.waitUntil()` for any Durable Object interactions or other background tasks to prevent the worker from terminating prematurely. The current diff does not include the implementation of `handleRawTTS`, so this cannot be verified here.\n\n[ADDRESSED] **Resolution**: The `handleRawTTS` function in `src/handlers/tts.mjs` already correctly utilizes `event.waitUntil()` for both the initial Durable Object interaction (storing job data) and the subsequent asynchronous `callGoogleTTSAPI` operation, including the storage of its result or error. This ensures that these background tasks are kept alive, preventing premature worker termination, and fully addresses the concern.",
