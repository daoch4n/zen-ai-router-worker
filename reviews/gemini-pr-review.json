While this addresses the immediate quota issues as described, the previous concern about hardcoding specific, potentially volatile preview model identifiers remains. These names could change or be deprecated, leading to future breakage.\n\nConsider externalizing these mappings (e.g., in a configuration file or environment variables) so they can be updated without code changes, or using more stable, general model aliases if available. If these are internal models, ensure their long-term stability is guaranteed.",
