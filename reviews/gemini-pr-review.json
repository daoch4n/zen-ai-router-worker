This issue has been addressed. The addition of `errorHandler` import is also consistent with the PR description's goal of improving error handling.",

However, these model names appear to be very specific preview versions. Hardcoding such specific, potentially volatile model identifiers could lead to future breakage if Google changes or deprecates these exact preview names.\n\nConsider if these models are stable enough for long-term use, or if there's a more general or configurable way to map to \"thinking\" models (e.g., using a configuration file or environment variables) that could be updated without code changes. If these are internal models, ensure their stability is guaranteed.",

      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: High**\n\nThe `errorType` mapping has been significantly improved based on the previous feedback, which is great. However, the `message` field still only uses `openAIRes.error.message`. To provide even richer feedback to the client and aid debugging, consider including more detailed fields from the upstream error object if available (e.g., `openAIRes.error.param`, `openAIRes.error.type`, or `openAIRes.error.details`). This would make the error messages more actionable.\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\nmessage: openAIRes.error.message || \"An unknown error occurred from the upstream API.\"\n// Consider enhancing the message like:\n// message: `Upstream error: ${openAIRes.error.message || 'Unknown'}` +\n//          (openAIRes.error.param ? ` (Param: ${openAIRes.error.param})` : '') +\n//          (openAIRes.error.type ? ` (Type: ${openAIRes.error.type})` : '') +\n//          (openAIRes.error.details ? ` (Details: ${JSON.stringify(openAIRes.error.details)})` : '')\n```",
