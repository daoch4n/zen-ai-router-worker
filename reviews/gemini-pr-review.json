The `embedContent` method in the Google Generative AI SDK typically processes a single input. If the `req.input` can still be an array of strings (as it was before), this change will either cause an error, process only the first element, or concatenate inputs, which fundamentally changes the embedding semantics.\n\nIf batch embedding is still a requirement (which the previous implementation suggests), consider one of the following:\n1.  Utilize `batchEmbedContents` if the SDK provides a direct method for it.\n2.  Iterate over the `req.input` array within `handleEmbeddings` and call `embedContent` for each item, then aggregate the results before processing the response.\n3.  If batching is no longer supported, the `transformRequest` function should explicitly handle this by either throwing an error for array inputs or clearly defining how multiple inputs are combined into a single embedding request (e.g., concatenation), and this change should be documented in the API contract.",

Previously, it was applied to the `response` object returned by `fetch`, which would have included any headers from the upstream Gemini API (e.g., rate-limit headers, `x-goog-api-client`).\n\nWhile `fixCors` primarily adds CORS headers, this change means any other non-CORS headers from the Gemini API response are no longer propagated to the client.

A more direct approach would be for `fixCors` to return the `Headers` or `ResponseInit` object directly, or to take the actual response object to modify it.\n\nConsider refactoring `fixCors` or its usage to be more explicit:\n\n1.  If `fixCors` returns a `Headers` object:\n    ```javascript\n    return new Response(body, { headers: fixCors() });\n    ```\n\n2.  If `fixCors` takes a `Response` object and returns a new one with CORS headers:\n    ```javascript\n    return fixCors(new Response(body));\n    ```\n\nThe current pattern `new Response(body, fixCors(new Response()))` suggests that `fixCors(new Response())` returns a `Response` object, which is then incorrectly passed as `ResponseInit` to the `Response` constructor.

However, `functionCall.args` and `functionResponse.response.result` are expected to be JSON objects by the Gemini API. If the input from OpenAI (`tool_calls.function.arguments` or `tool` message `content`) is malformed JSON, returning the raw string will likely cause an error when calling the Gemini API, as it expects a parsed object.

      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: High**\n\nThe previous review comment highlighted that the order of `else if` conditions in `errorHandler` could lead to less specific error handling being applied. While changes have been made, the issue persists and has introduced new inconsistencies, particularly with `GoogleGenerativeAIError`.\n\nCurrently:\n1. `else if (err.status)` (lines 46-50) is placed before `else if (err.name === \"GoogleGenerativeAIError\")` (lines 58-62). This means if a `GoogleGenerativeAIError` has a `status` property, it will be caught by the generic `err.status` block. This leads to:\n    - The `code` being `gemini_api_error_${status}` instead of the more consistent `gemini_api_error`.\n    - The `message` being `err.message` instead of `Gemini API error: ${err.message}`.\n    - The `GoogleGenerativeAIError` block (lines 58-62) will only be hit if `err.status` is `undefined` or `null`, making its `status` default to `500` even if a more specific status could have been derived from the error object itself. This creates inconsistent error responses for the same error type.\n\n2. `else if (err.cause?.response?.status)` (lines 52-56) is placed after `else if (err.status)` (lines 46-50). If an error has both a direct `status` and a `cause.response.status`, the direct `status` will be used, which might be less specific than the status from the underlying cause.\n\n**Suggestion:** Reorder the conditions to prioritize more specific error types and ensure consistent handling for `GoogleGenerativeAIError`. The `GoogleGenerativeAIError` block should be placed higher and handle both cases (with and without `err.status`) within itself. The `err.cause?.response?.status` should also be considered before a generic `err.status`.\n\nExample reordering:\n```javascript\nexport const errorHandler = (err, fixCors) => {\n  console.error(\"Caught error:\", err);\n\n  let status = 500;\n  let message = \"An unexpected error occurred.\";\n  let code = \"internal_error\";\n  let type = \"internal_error\";\n\n  // 1. Custom HttpError (most specific to this application)\n  if (err instanceof HttpError) {\n    status = err.status;\n    message = err.message;\n    code = `http_error_${status}`;\n    type = \"api_error\";\n  }\n  // 2. Specific Google Generative AI library error (prioritize consistent handling)\n  else if (err.name === \"GoogleGenerativeAIError\") {\n    status = err.status ?? 500; // Use err.status if available, otherwise default\n    message = `Gemini API error: ${err.message}`;\n    code = \"gemini_api_error\";\n    type = \"api_error\";\n  }\n  // 3. Specific heuristic for content blocking (often related to Gemini)\n  else if (err.message.includes(\"content blocked\")) {\n    status = 400; // Or 403\n    message = \"Content violates safety policies.\";\n    code = \"content_filter_violation\";\n    type = \"api_error\";\n  }\n  // 4. Specific nested status (e.g., from network issues wrapping a response)\n  else if (err.cause?.response?.status) {\n    status = err.cause.response.status;\n    message = err.message;\n    code = `gemini_api_error_${status}`; // Or a more generic code if not always Gemini\n    type = \"api_error\";\n  }\n  // 5. Generic APIError with status (e.g. from Cloudflare Workers AI)\n  else if (err.name === \"APIError\" && err.status) {\n    status = err.status;\n    message = err.message;\n    code = `api_error_${status}`;\n    type = \"api_error\";\n  }\n  // 6. General catch-all for errors with a direct status property\n  else if (err.status) {\n    status = err.status;\n    message = err.message;\n    code = `generic_api_error_${status}`; // Or a more specific code if possible\n    type = \"api_error\";\n  }\n\n  // ... rest of the function\n};\n```",
