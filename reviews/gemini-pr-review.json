However, the `TtsJobDurableObject` will remain in a 'processing' state indefinitely for this job, as it was never informed of the failure.\n\nConsider informing the Durable Object to mark the job as failed if the R2 bucket is not available, similar to the commented-out suggestion:\n\n```javascript\nif (!env.TTS_AUDIO_BUCKET) {\n    console.error(\"Orchestrator: TTS_AUDIO_BUCKET is not bound.\");\n    // Inform DO to mark job as failed\n    await doStub.fetch(`https://do-placeholder/tts-job/${jobId}/update-status`, { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ status: 'failed', errorMessage: 'TTS_AUDIO_BUCKET not bound' }) });\n    throw new HttpError(\"TTS service misconfigured (R2 bucket not bound)\", 500);\n}\n```",

This can lead to inconsistencies where the DO might still consider the sentence pending, potentially causing it to be re-processed or the overall job to hang.\n\nWhile the current code logs an error, it doesn't take corrective action. Consider implementing a retry mechanism for this DO update or marking the specific sentence as failed in the DO if the update consistently fails, to ensure the DO's state accurately reflects the job's progress.\n\n```javascript\nif (!markProcessedResponse.ok) {\n    const errorText = await markProcessedResponse.text();\n    console.error(`Orchestrator: Job ${jobId}, Sentence ${sentenceIndex} - Failed to mark as processed in DO.

While this prevents a single failing task from blocking the entire pipeline, if the DO consistently fails to provide sentences (e.g., due to an internal DO error or network issues), the `successfullyStreamedSentenceCount` might never reach `totalSentences`.\n\nThis could lead to the job hanging until the `dispatchNextTasks` fallback (lines 310-318) eventually closes the stream, but the Durable Object itself might still consider the job active.

However, it currently only logs a warning (`console.warn`). If the backend worker returns data for an incorrect job ID or sentence index, it indicates a significant data integrity issue or a misrouting problem.\n\nWhile a warning is helpful, for such a critical mismatch, it might be more appropriate to either:\n1. Throw an error to explicitly fail the processing of this sentence, which would then be caught by the outer `try-catch` and reported to the DO as a sentence failure.\n2. Implement a retry for this specific sentence, as the issue might be transient (e.g., a race condition or routing hiccup).",

However, the `handleStoreResult` and `handleGetResult` methods (lines 370-405) are designed to store and retrieve a *combined* audio file. It's unclear how these 'combined' methods fit into the new chunk-based architecture. \n\nIf the primary flow is now chunk-based, are these combined methods still necessary?
