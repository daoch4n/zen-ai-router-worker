Durable Objects are typically bound via `wrangler.toml` and accessed through the `env` object (e.g., `env.CONVERSATION_STATE.idFromName(...)`). Directly exporting the class from the worker file can be misleading, as it suggests it can be instantiated like a regular class, which is not how Durable Objects function in the Cloudflare runtime. Consider removing this export and ensuring `ConversationStateDO` is correctly configured as a Durable Object binding in your `wrangler.toml` (or `cloudflare.json`) file. If this class is not intended to be a Durable Object, its naming (`...DO`) and placement in a `do` folder are confusing.\n[ADDRESSED] **Resolution**: Removed the direct export of `ConversationStateDO` from `src/worker.mjs`.
