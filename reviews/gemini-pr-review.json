However, the `fetch` handler extracts a `jobIdFromPath` from the URL path segments and explicitly checks for its presence (`if (!jobIdFromPath || jobIdFromPath === 'initialize')`).\n\nThis creates an inconsistency: the `jobId` in the URL path for the `initialize` endpoint is effectively ignored by the `initializeJob` method. This could lead to:\n1.  **Security Risks**: A client could send a request to `/tts-job/job-id-A/initialize` but provide `\"jobId\": \"job-id-B\"` in the request body, leading to `job-id-B` being created under the `job-id-A` path context (if the path is used for subsequent lookups).\n2.  **Inconsistency**: The `jobId` used for storage might not match the `jobId` used in the URL for subsequent operations.\n\n**Suggestion**: Modify `initializeJob` to accept `jobIdFromPath` as an argument and use that as the definitive `jobId` for the job. If the body also contains a `jobId`, you could add a validation step to ensure it matches the `jobIdFromPath`.\n\n```javascript\n// In fetch method:\n// ...\nif (method === 'POST' &&\n    jobIdFromPath && jobIdFromPath !== 'initialize' &&\n    actionOrPrimaryResource === 'initialize' &&\n    pathSegments.length === 4) {\n  return this.initializeJob(request, jobIdFromPath); // Pass jobIdFromPath\n}\n// ...\n\n// In initializeJob method:\nasync initializeJob(request, jobIdFromPath) {\n  const { jobId: bodyJobId, text, voiceId, model, splittingPreference } = await request.json();\n\n  // Optional: Validate that bodyJobId matches jobIdFromPath if bodyJobId is expected\n  if (bodyJobId && bodyJobId !== jobIdFromPath) {\n    throw new HttpError(\"Job ID in path and body do not match.\", 400);\n  }\n\n  const jobId = jobIdFromPath; // Use the jobId from the path as the source of truth\n\n  if (!jobId || !text || !voiceId || !model || !splittingPreference) {\n    throw new HttpError(\"Missing required fields for job initialization: jobId, text, voiceId, model, splittingPreference\", 400);\n  }\n  // ... rest of the method using 'jobId'\n}\n```",

The PR description mentions they are copied from `orchestrator/src/utils/textProcessing.mjs`.\n\n**Suggestion**: To improve maintainability and avoid code duplication, these functions should be extracted into a shared utility module (e.g., `src/utils/textProcessing.mjs` if it's already there, or a new `shared/utils/textProcessing.mjs` if the orchestrator is in a different package) and imported into both the Durable Object and the orchestrator.\n\nThis ensures that any bug fixes or improvements to these functions are applied consistently across all parts of the application.",

This means the splitting is based on *character count*, not actual token count (which is typically more complex and depends on the TTS model's tokenizer).\n\n**Suggestion**: To avoid confusion and accurately reflect the behavior, consider renaming the `splittingPreference` option from `'tokenCount'` to `'characterCount'` or `'charLimit'`. If true token-based splitting is desired, a more sophisticated `getTokenCount` function would need to be implemented.",

It is not incremented if a sentence fails.\n\nWhile the `finalizedSentenceCount` correctly accounts for both `completed` and `failed` sentences to determine the overall job status, the `processedSentenceCount` might be misleading to clients trying to track overall progress, as it only reflects successful chunks.\n\n**Suggestion**: Clarify in documentation or comments that `processedSentenceCount` tracks *successfully completed* sentences. Alternatively, if the intent is for it to represent *any* sentence that has reached a terminal state (completed or failed), then it should be incremented in `updateJobStatus` when `sentenceIndexToFail` is provided, or consider a new metric like `finalizedSentenceCount` to expose to clients.",

However, the `handleStoreResult` and `handleGetResult` methods are retained and appear to handle a *combined* audio file for the entire job, storing it under a `combined/{jobId}` prefix in R2.\n\n**Suggestion**: Clarify this dual storage strategy in the PR description and any relevant documentation. It's important to distinguish between the chunk-based streaming approach and the optional combined audio output, as they serve different purposes and have different implications for storage and retrieval.",

In a Cloudflare Worker environment, a single worker instance can handle multiple concurrent requests. This creates a race condition where concurrent requests might read the same `apiKeyIndex` value, leading to lost updates and potentially causing the round-robin key selection to not behave as expected (e.g., the same key being used for consecutive requests, or keys being skipped).\n\nIf the intention is to have a truly global, atomic round-robin across all worker instances, consider using a Durable Object to manage and atomically increment this index. A Durable Object's `state.storage` operations are atomic for a single instance.\n\nExample of how a Durable Object could manage the index:\n\n```javascript\n// Inside a Durable Object's fetch method:\nasync fetch(request) {\n  let currentIndex = (await this.state.storage.get('apiKeyIndex')) || 0;\n  // Calculate next index based on available keys (passed or retrieved from env)\n  const nextIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % totalApiKeysCount;\n  await this.state.storage.put('apiKeyIndex', nextIndex);\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ index: currentIndex }));\n}\n\n// In worker.mjs fetch function:\n// ...\n// Get a stub to your ApiKeyIndex Durable Object\n// const id = env.API_KEY_INDEX_DO.idFromName('global_api_key_index');\n// const stub = env.API_KEY_INDEX_DO.get(id);\n// const response = await stub.fetch('http://do/increment_and_get_index');\n// const { index } = await response.json();\n// selectedApiKey = apiKeys[index];\n// ...\n```\n\nThis approach ensures atomic updates and a consistent global round-robin. If a truly global round-robin is not critical and a per-worker instance, non-atomic approach is acceptable, then the current implementation might suffice, but it's important to be aware of the race condition.",
