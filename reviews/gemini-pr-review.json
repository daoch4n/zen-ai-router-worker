      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: Medium**\n\nThe removal of the `if (sentenceLength > MAX_TEXT_LENGTH_CHAR_COUNT)` block in this hunk relies on the comment's assertion that \"The check above (lines 53-59) ensures no single sentence is *initially* too long.\" \n\nIt's critical to verify that this pre-validation is robust and explicitly throws an `HttpError` if any individual sentence, after `splitIntoSentences`, exceeds `MAX_TEXT_LENGTH_CHAR_COUNT`. If such a guarantee is not firmly in place, a single very long sentence (e.g., a long word without spaces) could still be passed into the batching logic, potentially causing issues if the downstream TTS service has a hard limit per segment.\n\nTo enhance robustness and clarity, consider adding an explicit validation loop for `initialSentences` *before* this batching loop, similar to the check implemented for `splittingPreference === 'none'` in Hunk 3. This would make the assumption explicit and prevent potential edge-case failures.\n\n```javascript\n// Example (conceptual, adjust to actual code structure):\n// ... after initialSentences = splitIntoSentences(text);\nfor (const sentence of initialSentences) {\n    if (getTextCharacterCount(sentence) > MAX_TEXT_LENGTH_CHAR_COUNT) {\n        throw new HttpError(\n            `A single sentence exceeds the maximum allowed length of ${MAX_TEXT_LENGTH_CHAR_COUNT} characters.`,\n            400\n        );\n    }\n}\n// ... then the batching loop follows\n```",

OpenAI expects a `messages` array (e.g., `[{ role: 'user', content: '...' }]`), while Gemini uses `contents` (e.g., `[{ role: 'user', parts: [{ text: '...' }] }]`).\n\nYou'll need to transform the `body` object from the Gemini-compatible structure to OpenAI's expected format before stringifying it for OpenAI requests. Failing to do so will result in API errors.\n\n**Example (conceptual transformation within the `isOpenAiModel` block):**\n\n```javascript\n// ... inside the isOpenAiModel block\n\nlet openAiBody = {\n  model: model, // Ensure this maps to a valid OpenAI model name\n  messages: body.contents.map(item => ({\n    role: item.role,\n    content: item.parts.map(part => part.text).join('') // Simple text conversion\n  })),\n  // Add other relevant fields like 'temperature', 'max_tokens', 'tools' etc.,\n  // mapping them from the original 'body' if they exist.\n  // For 'tools', OpenAI expects a different structure than Gemini.\n};\n\n// ... later in the fetch call\nbody: JSON.stringify(openAiBody),\n```\n\nThis is a critical logic flaw that will lead to API errors when using OpenAI models.",

Previously, they would be sent to the Google API as `models/gemini-pro`. Now, they are mapped to `models/${DEFAULT_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL}`. If the intention is to strictly use `DEFAULT_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL` for all non-`models/` prefixed Google models, this is correct. However, if `gemini-pro` (or similar) was expected to be used directly, this is a breaking change. Please clarify if this change is intentional and if `gemini-pro` is not an embedding model itself.",

While returning available models is good, consider adding a `warnings` field to the successful response body that lists details of any providers that failed to fetch models. This would provide more comprehensive feedback to the client.
