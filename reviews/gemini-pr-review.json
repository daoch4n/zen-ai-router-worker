This is because the variable `overallOrchestratorTimeoutMs` is declared and assigned a value *inside* the `ctx.waitUntil` block (line 615), which executes asynchronously *after* the `return new Response(...)` statement (line 625).\n\nTo fix this, calculate an estimated `orchestratorTimeoutMs` *before* the `ctx.waitUntil` block, based on the maximum character count of any chunk (or total text length), and include that in the immediate response. The `orchestratorTimeoutMs` stored in the Durable Object (within `ctx.waitUntil`) can remain as the more precise, post-processing value.\n\n```javascript\n// Proposed change in handleTtsInitiate, before ctx.waitUntil:\nconst maxCharCountInAnyChunk = Math.max(...chunkLengths);\n// Using the max possible timeout for a single chunk as an estimate for the client\nconst estimatedClientTimeoutMs = Math.min(5000 + (maxCharCountInAnyChunk * 35), 70000) + 5000;\n\n// ...\n\n// In the return statement for handleTtsInitiate (around line 625):\nreturn new Response(JSON.stringify({\n    jobId, totalChunks, expectedMimeType, chunkLengths, sentenceMapping,\n    orchestratorTimeoutMs: estimatedClientTimeoutMs // Use the estimated value here\n}), {\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    status: 200\n});\n```",

However, the `_callBackendTtsService`'s `catch (e)` block handles all errors generically. While it correctly returns `{ success: false, ... }`, it might be beneficial to specifically check `if (e instanceof HttpError)` to propagate the original status code and message more directly, rather than potentially wrapping it in \"Unknown error during backend TTS fetch.\" or just `e.message`. This would provide more precise error reporting to the caller of `_callBackendTtsService`.\n\n```javascript\n// Proposed change in _callBackendTtsService catch block (around line 212):\n} catch (e) {\n    clearTimeout(timeoutId); // Ensure timeout is cleared\n\n    if (e instanceof HttpError) {\n        console.error(`Orchestrator: HttpError during backend TTS fetch: ${e.message} (status: ${e.status}).`);\n        return { success: false, index: chunkIndex, errorMessage: e.message, status: e.status, timeoutMs: null };\n    }\n\n    if (e.name === 'AbortError') {\n        return { success: false, index: chunkIndex, errorMessage: `API call timed out after ${timeoutMs}ms`, status: 504, timeoutMs: null };\n    }\n\n    if (i < maxRetries) {\n        const delay = Math.pow(2, i) * baseDelayMs;\n        console.warn(`Orchestrator: Error during backend TTS fetch: ${e.message}.

The `gemini_rate_limit_lock` ensures that the `LAST_GEMINI_REQUEST_TIME` is updated safely, preventing multiple threads from bypassing the rate limit simultaneously. More importantly, the `gemini_api_interaction_lock` around `Client.configure` and `gemini_model.generate_content` is crucial. Since `Client.configure` likely modifies a global state for the API key, and `generate_content` makes the actual call, this lock prevents race conditions where one thread might overwrite another's API key configuration or make a call with an outdated key. This significantly enhances the stability and correctness of parallel API interactions.",

This function will cause a runtime error in the Worker environment.\n\nFor encoding `ArrayBuffer` to Base64 in Cloudflare Workers, you typically need to convert the `ArrayBuffer` to a binary string (e.g., using `Uint8Array` and `String.fromCharCode` or `TextDecoder` if applicable) and then use `btoa()`. Be mindful of potential `Maximum call stack size exceeded` errors for very large `ArrayBuffer`s when using `String.fromCharCode.apply` directly; you might need to process in chunks.\n\nConsider an alternative implementation like this (for arbitrary binary data, potentially needing chunking for very large buffers):\n\n```javascript\nexport function arrayBufferToBase64(buffer) {\n  if (!(buffer instanceof ArrayBuffer)) {\n    throw new Error('Invalid input: must be an ArrayBuffer.');\n  }\n  const bytes = new Uint8Array(buffer);\n  let binaryString = '';\n  for (let i = 0; i < bytes.byteLength; i++) {\n    binaryString += String.fromCharCode(bytes[i]);\n  }\n  return btoa(binaryString);\n}\n```\n\nNote: The above example might still hit performance/memory limits for extremely large buffers due to string concatenation.
