For longer texts, this can lead to a significant delay (tens of seconds to minutes), potentially causing client timeouts or a poor user experience.\n\nThis design shifts from the previous SSE streaming model (where chunks were sent as they became available) to a batch-then-poll model. While polling individual chunks (`/api/tts-chunk`) is supported, the initial `tts-initiate` call is blocking.\n\n**Suggestion:** Consider if the `handleTtsInitiate` endpoint should return more quickly with the `jobId` and `totalChunks` *before* all chunks are generated and stored. The backend workers could then process the chunks asynchronously, and the client would immediately start polling `/api/tts-chunk` to retrieve them as they become available (or after a short delay for the first chunk).\n\nExample of a non-blocking initiate flow:\n1. Client calls `/api/tts-initiate`.\n2. Orchestrator generates `jobId`, splits text, and *initiates* asynchronous calls to backend workers (e.g., using `ctx.waitUntil` for each chunk generation if applicable, or a background process).\n3. Orchestrator immediately stores *metadata* about the job (like `jobId`, `totalChunks`, `expectedMimeType`) in the DO, and returns `jobId` and `totalChunks` to the client.\n4. Client starts polling `/api/tts-chunk` for `chunkIndex = 0, 1, ...`.\n5. Backend workers complete chunk generation and store chunks in the DO.\n6. `handleTtsChunk` retrieves chunks from DO as they become available.",

This `jobId` is crucial for the subsequent polling mechanism (`_pollForTtsResult`).\n\n**Action:** Ensure that the backend worker implementation consistently provides this `jobId` in the specified format when returning a `202` status, as a mismatch here would break the asynchronous TTS flow.",

      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: Medium**\n\nThe `handleTtsInitiate` function uses `Promise.allSettled` and if `failedChunks.length > 0`, it returns a `500` error, indicating that if *any* chunk fails to generate, the entire TTS initiation request fails. While this ensures data integrity for the full job, it might be overly strict for very long texts where a single chunk failure shouldn't necessarily invalidate the entire process.\n\n**Consideration:** Depending on the desired user experience, you might consider a partial success model. For example, the `tts-initiate` could return successfully with the `jobId` and `totalChunks`, and then individual `tts-chunk` requests could return errors for specific failed chunks. This would require more complex client-side error handling but could offer a more resilient experience for long audio generation.",
