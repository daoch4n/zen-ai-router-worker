Calling it internally from `handleTtsInitiate` for each sentence chunk introduces redundancy and potential confusion.\n\n*   Each call to `handleRawTTS` will re-authenticate and increment the `ROUTER_COUNTER`, which is inefficient.\n*   The `request.url` passed to `handleRawTTS` will be the original `/api/tts-initiate` URL, which is then internally corrected to `/api/rawtts`. While this correction works, it's an indirect and less clear way to call an internal service.\n\n**Suggestion**: Extract the core logic for making the backend TTS call (worker selection, URL construction, fetch request) into a separate, dedicated helper function (e.g., `_callBackendTtsService`). Both `handleRawTTS` (for external requests) and `handleTtsInitiate` (for internal chunk processing) can then call this helper function. This would improve modularity, clarity, and potentially performance.\n\n```javascript\n// Proposed helper function\nasync function _callBackendTtsService(text, voiceId, model, apiKey, env, backendServices, numSrcWorkers) {\n    // ... (worker selection, backend URL construction, fetch logic)\n    // This function would return { audioContentBase64, mimeType } or throw HttpError\n}\n\nasync function handleRawTTS(request, env, backendServices, numSrcWorkers) {\n    // ... authentication and parameter parsing ...\n    try {\n        const { audioContentBase64, mimeType } = await _callBackendTtsService(text, voiceId, model, apiKey, env, backendServices, numSrcWorkers);\n        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ audioContentBase64, mimeType }), { /* ... */ });\n    } catch (e) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nasync function handleTtsInitiate(request, env, backendServices, numSrcWorkers) {\n    // ... authentication and splitting logic ...\n    const audioChunkPromises = sentences.map(async (sentence, index) => {\n        try {\n            const { audioContentBase64, mimeType } = await _callBackendTtsService(sentence, voiceId, model, apiKey, env, backendServices, numSrcWorkers);\n            return { index, audioContentBase64, mimeType, error: null };\n        } catch (e) {\n            return { index, audioContentBase64: null, mimeType: null, error: e.message };\n        }\n    });\n    // ... Promise.allSettled and storage ...\n}\n```",

If `job.audioChunks` were `null`, `undefined`, or a non-array type due to a storage corruption or unexpected state, accessing `.length` would throw an error.\n\n**Suggestion**: Add a more robust check to ensure `job.audioChunks` is an array before accessing its length and elements.\n\nExample: `if (!job || !Array.isArray(job.audioChunks) || chunkIndex < 0 || chunkIndex >= job.audioChunks.length)`",

This means the progress bar now reflects the progress of fetching and decoding audio chunks from the server, rather than the progress of audio playback. While this is a valid design choice for a 'loading' indicator, it changes the user experience. Users might expect the progress bar to track the actual audio playback position. Consider if this new behavior aligns with user expectations or if a separate playback progress indicator is needed.",

If the goal is to show overall progress of the TTS generation, this is fine. However, if the user expects to see the progress of the audio *currently playing*, this might be misleading. For very long texts, there could be a significant delay between a chunk being fetched and it actually playing, making the progress bar appear 'stuck' even if audio is playing.\n\nConsider clarifying the purpose of this progress bar in the UI or adding a separate progress bar for audio playback if desired.",

For very long texts that result in a large number of audio chunks (e.g., hundreds or thousands), this recursive approach could potentially lead to a JavaScript call stack overflow. While unlikely for typical TTS use cases, it's a robustness concern.\n\nFor more robust handling of a potentially large number of chunks, consider refactoring this into an iterative loop (e.g., a `for` or `while` loop with `await`) rather than recursion.\n\nExample (pseudocode):\n```javascript\nconst fetchAllChunks = async (jobId, totalChunks, initialChunkIndex) => {\n  for (let chunkIndex = initialChunkIndex; chunkIndex < totalChunks; chunkIndex++) {\n    // ... existing fetch logic for a single chunk ...\n    await fetch(`${window.ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_URL}/api/tts-chunk?jobId=${jobId}&chunkIndex=${chunkIndex}`, ...);\n    // ... decode, push to queue, update progress ...\n  }\n  // ... handle completion ...\n};\n\n// Call it like:\nfetchAllChunks(jobId, totalChunks, 0);\n```",
