For streaming, `tool_calls` typically appear as a list of objects, and subsequent chunks might provide additional arguments or confirm the tool call. The current implementation might not correctly aggregate or update `tool_calls` across chunks, leading to malformed or incomplete tool call objects in the streamed response.\n\n**Suggestion:** Review and correct the `tool_calls` streaming logic in `toOpenAiStream` to ensure that partial `functionCall` objects are correctly buffered and assembled across stream chunks, providing a complete and valid `tool_calls` array in the final streamed `delta`.\n\n[ADDRESSED] **Resolution**: Corrected `tool_calls` streaming logic in `toOpenAiStream` to properly represent updates and aggregate partial `functionCall` objects across stream chunks.",

In streaming scenarios, it's crucial to ensure all buffered data, especially for `tool_calls` or other multi-chunk elements, is properly emitted as a final delta before the stream concludes. Failure to flush can lead to incomplete data being sent to the client.\n\n**Suggestion:** Implement or restore the flush logic in `toOpenAiStreamFlush` to ensure that any remaining data in `this.last` or similar internal buffers is processed and sent as a final delta, guaranteeing complete streamed responses.\n\n[ADDRESSED] **Resolution**: Restored flush logic for `this.last` array in `toOpenAiStreamFlush` to ensure all buffered data is properly emitted as a final delta.",

For serverless environments or applications where the API key is managed globally (e.g., through environment variables or a configuration service), passing it directly here can be redundant and potentially expose the key if not handled carefully.
