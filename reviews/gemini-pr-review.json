It's best practice to remove such comments from the final code, as they refer to previous states of the file and can become confusing over time. This issue was previously noted and remains unaddressed.",

While defining it as a `const` improves maintainability by centralizing the value, it doesn't address the previous suggestion of making it configurable (e.g., via a UI dropdown or a global JavaScript configuration variable) if there's a possibility of supporting different TTS models in the future. This would enhance flexibility without requiring code changes for model switching.",

This might not always accurately reflect the overall audio generation progress, especially if text chunks vary significantly in length or if the backend processes them non-linearly. A more robust approach for overall progress would be to base it on the `chunkIndex` relative to `totalChunks` (i.e., `(chunkIndex / totalChunks) * 100`), as `totalChunks` is provided by the initial `tts-initiate` response. This would give a more consistent representation of the entire job's completion.",
