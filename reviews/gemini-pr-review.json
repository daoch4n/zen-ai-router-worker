This means it decrements *before* the fetch operation has actually completed or settled. This will lead to more concurrent fetches than `MAX_CONCURRENT_SENTENCE_FETCHES` allows, potentially overwhelming backend services or exceeding resource limits.\n\n**Suggestion:** Move the `activeFetches--` into a `.finally()` block of the `currentPromise` to ensure it only decrements when the promise has settled (either resolved or rejected). Also, call `processQueue()` again within the `.finally()` block to ensure new tasks are picked up as soon as a slot becomes available.\n\n```javascript\n        const currentPromise = (async () => {\n            // ... existing fetch logic ...\n            return result;\n        })();\n\n        outstandingPromises.add(currentPromise);\n        currentPromise.finally(() => {\n            activeFetches--; // Decrement when promise settles\n            outstandingPromises.delete(currentPromise);\n            processQueue(); // Attempt to process more from the queue\n        });\n\n        currentPromise.then(resolve, reject); // Resolve/reject the original promise\n        // Remove the old activeFetches--; and processQueue(); from here\n```",

This means that when a `fetch` request arrives shortly after the Durable Object is instantiated, the in-memory state (`this.text`, `this.voiceId`, `this.initialised`, etc.) might not yet be populated from storage, even if `loadState` has been initiated.\n\nThe current check in `fetch`: `if (!this.initialised && (await this.state.storage.get(\"initialised\")) === false)` attempts to mitigate this, but it doesn't guarantee that all in-memory state variables are fully loaded before other methods (like `getJobState` or `initialise`) are called. If `this.initialised` is `false` (because `loadState` hasn't completed) but storage returns `true` (because it was previously initialized), the request will proceed with potentially uninitialized in-memory state.\n\nTo ensure consistency and prevent race conditions, it's best practice to store the `loadState` promise in the constructor and `await` it at the beginning of the `fetch` method (and potentially `initialise` if it's meant to be idempotent after a restart). This guarantees the Durable Object's state is fully loaded into memory before any request is processed.\n\n```javascript\nexport class TTSStateDurableObject {\n    constructor(state, env) {\n        // ... other initializations ...\n        this.initialised = false; \n\n        // Store the promise from loadState\n        this.loadStatePromise = this.loadState().then(() => {\n            console.log(\"TTSStateDurableObject constructor: state loaded.\");\n        }).catch(error => {\n            console.error(\"TTSStateDurableObject constructor: failed to load state:\", error);\n            this.initialised = false; \n            // Consider re-throwing or storing the error to prevent processing requests\n            throw error; // Re-throw to propagate the error to the promise chain\n        });\n    }\n\n    async initialise(text, voiceId) {\n        // Wait for the initial load to complete before checking initialised status\n        await this.loadStatePromise; \n\n        if (this.initialised) { // Now this.initialised is reliable\n            console.log(\"TTSStateDurableObject already initialised.\");\n            return;\n        }\n        // ... rest of initialise logic ...\n    }\n\n    async fetch(request) {\n        // Ensure state is loaded before processing any request\n        try {\n            await this.loadStatePromise;\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.error(\"TTSStateDurableObject fetch: initial state load failed.\", error);\n            return new Response(\"Durable Object failed to initialize state.\", { status: 500 });\n        }\n\n        // Now this.initialised and other state variables are guaranteed to be loaded.\n        if (!this.initialised) {\n             console.error(\"TTSStateDurableObject not initialized, cannot process request.\");\n             return new Response(\"Durable Object not initialized.\", { status: 500 });\n        }\n        // ... rest of fetch logic ...\n    }\n}\n```",

If the orchestrator's logic for identifying backend services iterates through `env` properties (e.g., `Object.values(env).filter(v => v && v.fetch)`) or checks for `BACKEND_SERVICE_X` keys, then `BACKEND_SERVICE_0` would be detected as a valid service. In this case, `999 % 1 = 0`, meaning `mockBackendService1` (assigned to `BACKEND_SERVICE_0`) would be selected, and the test would not result in the expected 'Failed to select target worker for routing.' error.\n\nTo reliably test the scenario where no worker can be selected, ensure that the `backendServices` array within the orchestrator's `fetch` handler is truly empty or that the calculated `targetWorkerIndex` is guaranteed to be out of bounds. A simpler approach might be to just set `env.BACKEND_SERVICE_1 = undefined; env.BACKEND_SERVICE_2 = undefined;` and rely on the orchestrator's internal logic to find no available services, assuming it only looks for `BACKEND_SERVICE_1`, `BACKEND_SERVICE_2`, etc. If it discovers services dynamically, you might need to mock the discovery mechanism to return an empty list.",

The line `window.AudioContext.mockImplementation(() => mockAudioContextInstance);` is incorrect because `window.AudioContext` is a class constructor, not a Jest mock function that can have `mockImplementation` called on it directly.\n\nAs a result, the `audioContext` instance created within the script (inside `eventSource.onopen`) is a *different* instance than `mockAudioContextInstance` created in the test. Therefore, assertions like `expect(mockAudioContextInstance.decodeAudioData).toHaveBeenCalled()` will always fail because the script's `audioContext` instance is the one actually being used.\n\nTo correctly test this, you should make `MockAudioContext` itself a Jest mock function constructor, which allows you to inspect its instances. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// In your global mocks:\nconst MockAudioContext = jest.fn(function() {\n  this.decodeAudioData = jest.fn(buffer => Promise.resolve(new MockAudioBuffer(1, 44100, 44100)));\n  this.createBuffer = jest.fn((channels, length, sampleRate) => new MockAudioBuffer(channels, length, sampleRate));\n  this.createBufferSource = jest.fn(() => new MockAudioBufferSourceNode());\n  this.destination = {};\n  this.currentTime = 0;\n  this.baseLatency = 0;\n});\nObject.defineProperty(window, 'AudioContext', { value: MockAudioContext });\n\n// In your test:\nit('should process audio chunks and play them', async () => {\n  // ... setup ...\n  dispatchClick(speakButton);\n  mockEventSourceInstance._simulateOpen(); // This triggers new AudioContext()\n\n  // Get the actual AudioContext instance created by the script\n  const scriptAudioContext = MockAudioContext.mock.instances[0];\n  expect(scriptAudioContext).toBeDefined();\n\n  // Simulate first audio chunk\n  mockEventSourceInstance._simulateMessage({ audioChunk: btoa('raw_audio_data_1'), index: 0, mimeType: 'audio/opus' });\n  await Promise.resolve();\n\n  expect(scriptAudioContext.decodeAudioData).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  expect(scriptAudioContext.createBufferSource).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n\n  const firstSourceNode = scriptAudioContext.createBufferSource.mock.results[0].value;\n  expect(firstSourceNode).toBeInstanceOf(MockAudioBufferSourceNode);\n  expect(firstSourceNode.start).toHaveBeenCalled();\n\n  // ... continue with second chunk and onended ...\n  mockEventSourceInstance._simulateMessage({ audioChunk: btoa('raw_audio_data_2'), index: 1, mimeType: 'audio/opus' });\n  await Promise.resolve();\n\n  firstSourceNode.onended();\n  await Promise.resolve();\n\n  expect(scriptAudioContext.createBufferSource).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);\n  const secondSourceNode = scriptAudioContext.createBufferSource.mock.results[1].value;\n  expect(secondSourceNode.start).toHaveBeenCalled();\n});\n```\n\nThis approach ensures you are asserting on the actual `AudioContext` instance and its methods that the application code is interacting with.",

Consider adding a timeout mechanism or a strategy to skip missing chunks after a certain delay to prevent complete stalling. For example, if `audioQueue` contains `index+N` but `index` is expected, after `X` seconds, play `index+N` and log a warning about the missing chunk.
