If your backend workers require an API key for authentication (e.g., `Bearer ${apiKey}`), this change will likely lead to authentication failures (401/403 errors) and prevent TTS generation.\n\nPlease ensure that any necessary authentication headers are included when making requests to the backend TTS worker. For example:\n\n```javascript\nconst headersToSend = {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` // Re-add if required by backend\n};\n```",

To promote code reuse and maintainability, these functions should be moved to a shared utility module (e.g., `src/utils/textProcessing.mjs`) and imported into `TtsJobDurableObject.mjs`. This avoids duplication and ensures consistency if these utilities are used elsewhere.",

However, the Durable Object instance itself is identified by the `jobId` in the URL path (`jobIdFromPath`). It's crucial to ensure consistency. Please add a check to verify that `jobId` from the request body matches `jobIdFromPath` from the URL. If they differ, an `HttpError` (e.g., 400 Bad Request) should be thrown to prevent potential state inconsistencies or misrouted operations.\n\n```javascript\nasync initializeJob(request) {\n  const { jobId, text, voiceId, model, splittingPreference } = await request.json();\n  const url = new URL(request.url);\n  const jobIdFromPath = url.pathname.split('/')[2];\n\n  if (jobId !== jobIdFromPath) {\n    throw new HttpError(\"Job ID in body must match job ID in URL path.\", 400);\n  }\n  // ... rest of the logic\n}\n```",

This means the splitting is based on character count, not actual linguistic tokens or LLM tokens. To avoid confusion, consider renaming `splittingPreference: 'tokenCount'` to `splittingPreference: 'characterCount'` or `splittingPreference: 'charLimit'` to accurately reflect the implementation. If true tokenization (e.g., for LLM context windows) is intended, a more sophisticated `getTextCharacterCount` implementation would be required.",

If an invalid string is provided, it will fall through to the default `splitIntoSentences(text)` behavior, which might not be the intended error handling. It's best to explicitly validate `splittingPreference` against expected values to ensure robust API behavior.\n\n```javascript\nif (!['tokenCount', 'none', 'sentence'].includes(splittingPreference)) {\n  throw new HttpError(\"Invalid splittingPreference.
