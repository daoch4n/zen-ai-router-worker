The global `gh` client and `authenticator` instance should already hold the necessary credentials from the script's initialization.\n\nThis re-authentication is redundant and can be inefficient. If the `pr` object somehow loses its authentication context, it's generally better to refresh the `pr` object using the *existing* `gh` client rather than re-authenticating the entire application.\n\n**Suggestion:** Rely on the globally initialized `gh` client and `authenticator.token` for all GitHub API interactions.

According to Anthropic's API, `tool_use` is used when the model wants to use a tool, and `tool_result` is used when the *user* provides the outcome of a tool execution. If the OpenAI model returns `tool_calls` (or `function_call`), it means it's *requesting* a tool use. Therefore, the Anthropic response should always contain `type: \"tool_use\"`. If the arguments are malformed or indicate an error, the `input` field should reflect this (e.g., `{ error: \"Malformed arguments\" }` or `{}`), but the type should remain `tool_use`. Propagating tool execution errors (if that's what `is_error` signifies) should be handled by the component that executes the tool, potentially by sending a `tool_result` message back to Anthropic in a subsequent turn, not by misrepresenting the model's initial `tool_use` request.",
