It assumes a specific naming convention (`KEYn`) and will pick the first one it finds. If multiple `KEYn` variables exist, or if the naming convention changes (e.g., `APP_KEY_1`), this could lead to incorrect key usage or failure to find a valid key.\n\nConsider making the API key configuration more explicit, perhaps by defining a specific environment variable for the backend worker key, or by allowing a comma-separated list if multiple keys are intended to be tried. This would improve clarity and robustness.\n\n```javascript\n// Alternative 1: Explicit dedicated env var\nconst backendApiKey = env.BACKEND_WORKER_API_KEY || env.GOOGLE_API_KEY;\n\n// Alternative 2: If multiple keys are possible, define them clearly\n// const backendApiKey = env.GOOGLE_API_KEY || env.BACKEND_API_KEY_1; // Or similar explicit naming\n```",

While a warning is logged, if the backend worker at `/api/rawtts` strictly requires authentication, this will lead to an unauthorized error or a failed request from the backend.\n\nIt's crucial to clarify the authentication requirements for the backend worker. If an API key is mandatory for this endpoint, the orchestrator should throw an error early if no key is configured, rather than sending a request that is guaranteed to fail.\n\n```javascript\n// ... (API key determination logic)\n\nif (!backendApiKey) {\n    // If backend authentication is mandatory, throw an error\n    console.error(`Orchestrator: Job ${jobId}, Sentence ${sentenceIndex} - No API Key found for backend worker. Authentication is required for /api/rawtts.`);\n    throw new HttpError('Backend authentication key missing', 500); // Or a more specific error type\n}\n\nconst headersToSend = { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' };\nheadersToSend['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${backendApiKey}`;\nconsole.log(`Orchestrator: Job ${jobId}, Sentence ${sentenceIndex} - Using API Key for backend worker: Present`);\n\n// ...

If future text processing changes might reintroduce the need for such a check, it can be added back then.",

However, it is being passed to handlers for non-Google services such as Anthropic (`handleAnthropicCompletions`), OpenAI completions (`handleCompletions`), embeddings (`handleEmbeddings`), and models (`handleModels`).\n\nThese handlers likely expect an API key relevant to their respective services (e.g., an Anthropic API key or an OpenAI API key), which would typically be provided by the client in the `Authorization` header. The previous `selectedApiKey` (derived from `getRandomApiKey`) would have handled this for non-TTS routes.\n\nWhile `authenticateClientRequest` is now called, it primarily validates the client's request and does not return the client-provided API key for use by these downstream handlers. Passing a Google API key to these non-Google handlers will lead to authentication failures or incorrect behavior.\n\n**Suggestion:**\nReintroduce a mechanism to extract and pass the client-provided API key (e.g., from the `Authorization` header) to `handleAnthropicCompletions`, `handleCompletions`, `handleEmbeddings`, and `handleModels`. The `googleApiKeyForBackend` should only be used for Google-specific services like TTS.\n\nFor example, if `authenticateClientRequest` could return the client's API key:\n\n```javascript\ncase url.pathname.endsWith(\"/v1/messages\"):\n  if (!(request.method === \"POST\")) {\n    throw new HttpError(\"Method Not Allowed\", 405);\n  }\n  const clientApiKey = authenticateClientRequest(request, env); // Assuming it returns the key\n  return handleAnthropicCompletions(await request.json(), clientApiKey, env)\n    .catch(errHandler);\n```\n\nAlternatively, if these handlers are expected to extract the key themselves from the `request` object, then passing `googleApiKeyForBackend` is misleading and should be removed.",
