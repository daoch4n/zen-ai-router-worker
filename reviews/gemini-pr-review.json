The `url` object, which is already available in the `fetch` function, is now passed directly to `handleTtsRequest`. This eliminates the redundant `new URL(request.url)` call within `handleTtsRequest`, improving efficiency by avoiding unnecessary re-parsing of the URL.\n\n1.  **Modified `fetch` function call:** The line `return handleTtsRequest(request, env, backendServices, numSrcWorkers);` in the `fetch` function (line 31) was updated to `return handleTtsRequest(request, env, backendServices, numSrcWorkers, url);` to pass the already parsed `url` object.\n2.  **Updated `handleTtsRequest` signature:** The function signature for `handleTtsRequest` (line 61) was changed from `async function handleTtsRequest(request, env, backendServices, numSrcWorkers)` to `async function handleTtsRequest(request, env, backendServices, numSrcWorkers, url)` to accept the new `url` parameter.\n3.  **Removed redundant URL parsing:** The line `const url = new URL(request.url);` (line 76) within `handleTtsRequest` was removed, as the `url` object is now passed as an argument.",

The `/rawtts` endpoint, which returns base64 audio, appears to be the intended replacement for TTS functionality within this worker. Clients previously utilizing the `/tts` endpoint will need to update their implementations to use `/rawtts` or the new `/api/tts-stream` endpoint handled by the orchestrator (as discussed in previous comments).

However, the current `speakButton` click handler logic does not appear to utilize these timeouts to prevent the UI from hanging if the SSE stream stops sending data prematurely or the first chunk never arrives. This could lead to a poor user experience where the loading indicator remains indefinitely.\n\nConsider adding `setTimeout` calls to the `connectToEventSource` function or within the `speakButton` handler's `try` block. These timeouts should trigger an error message and reset the UI if no data is received within the specified duration.\n\nFor example, a timeout for the first sentence:\n```javascript\nlet firstChunkTimeout;\neventSource.onopen = () => {\n  // ...\n  firstChunkTimeout = setTimeout(() => {\n    if (audioQueue.length === 0 && !connectionErrorOccurred) {\n      showToast('Error: First audio chunk timed out.', 'error');\n      eventSource.close();\n      speakButton.disabled = false;\n      loadingIndicator.style.display = 'none';\n    }\n  }, FIRST_SENTENCE_TIMEOUT_MS);\n};\neventSource.onmessage = async (event) => {\n  // ...\n  clearTimeout(firstChunkTimeout); // Clear once first chunk arrives\n  // ...\n};\n```\nAdd corresponding tests to verify these timeout scenarios.",

The `ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_URL` is now defined as a module-scoped `const` on line 6 of this hunk. This means `window.ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_URL` will almost always be `undefined` unless explicitly set globally elsewhere.\n\nAs a result, this `if` condition will always evaluate to `true`, causing the `speakButton` to be disabled and an error toast to be shown, preventing the TTS functionality from ever working with the hardcoded URL. The `connectToEventSource` function already receives the correct `ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_URL` from the module scope.\n\n**Suggestion:** Remove this `if` block entirely. Any validation of the `ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_URL` should be handled within the `setupTTSClient` module itself, or by checking the module-scoped `ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_URL` constant directly if necessary.",

The `headers` option provided in the constructor will be ignored by the browser, leading to failed authentication if the backend relies on this header.\n\nTo pass an API key, you typically need to include it as a query parameter in the URL, or manage authentication via cookies. If `Authorization` header is strictly required, you might need to use `fetch` to get the stream and parse it manually, which is more complex than using `EventSource` directly.\n\n**Suggestion:** Modify the `sseUrl` to include the `apiKey` as a query parameter:\n\n```javascript\nconst sseUrl = `${window.ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER_URL}/api/tts-stream?voiceId=${encodeURIComponent(voiceId)}&text=${encodeURIComponent(text)}&apiKey=${encodeURIComponent(apiKey)}`;\nconst eventSource = new EventSource(sseUrl);\n// Remove the headers option\n```\n\nEnsure your backend is updated to expect the API key in the query parameter.",

It relies on `data.text` (the sentence from the SSE stream) being split identically to how the original `text` was split into `words`.\n\nSpecifically, `words[i].text === sentenceWords[wordCursor]` can fail if the original `text.split(/\\b(\\w+)\\b|\\s+/).filter(Boolean)` produces words with punctuation (e.g., \"Hello,\") while `data.text.split(...)` for a sentence like \"Hello\" produces \"Hello\".\n\nThis inconsistency will lead to incorrect `sentenceIndex` assignments, causing highlighting to be inaccurate or fail for certain words.\n\n**Suggestion:**\n1.  **Backend Enhancement:** The most robust solution is for the backend to provide more precise word-level information (e.g., start/end character offsets, or word indices within the original text) along with the audio chunks. This would allow for exact mapping.\n2.  **Frontend Refinement (if backend change is not possible):** If the backend cannot provide more detail, consider a more resilient matching strategy. For example, normalize words (lowercase, remove punctuation) before comparison, or use fuzzy matching. However, this is still a heuristic.\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a more robust (but still heuristic) comparison:\n// In eventSource.onmessage:\nif (data.text) {\n    const sentenceWordsNormalized = data.text.split(/\\b(\\w+)\\b|\\s+/).filter(Boolean).map(w => w.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, ''));\n    let wordCursor = 0;\n    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {\n        if (!words[i].isSeparator) {\n            const currentWordNormalized = words[i].text.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '');\n            if (currentWordNormalized === sentenceWordsNormalized[wordCursor]) {\n                words[i].sentenceIndex = index;\n                wordCursor++;\n                if (wordCursor === sentenceWordsNormalized.length) break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis still isn't perfect but might improve robustness for some cases.",

While common in simple client-side scripts, it's generally better practice to encapsulate configuration.\n\n**Suggestion:** Pass `orchestratorWorkerUrl` directly to `connectToEventSource` as an argument, or store it in a local variable within the `setupTTSClient` closure if it's only used by functions returned from `setupTTSClient`.\n\n```javascript\nexport function setupTTSClient(orchestratorWorkerUrl) {\n    // ... other variables\n\n    const connectToEventSource = (text, voiceId, apiKey, downloadButtonLink, speakButton, loadingIndicator, loadingText, progressBarContainer, progressBar, textDisplayArea) => {\n        // ...\n        const sseUrl = `${orchestratorWorkerUrl}/api/tts-stream?voiceId=${encodeURIComponent(voiceId)}&text=${encodeURIComponent(text)}`;\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    return { connectToEventSource, showToast, bufferToWave };\n}\n```",

This complexity is compounded by the fragile sentence-to-word mapping later in `onmessage`.\n\nWhile it attempts to preserve separators, consider if a simpler or more explicit tokenization strategy would be more maintainable and less prone to mismatches with the `data.text` from the SSE stream. For example, a simpler split by space and then a separate step to identify and handle punctuation, or using a dedicated NLP library if more advanced tokenization is needed.\n\nGiven the downstream dependency on this splitting for highlighting and progress, ensuring its robustness is key.",
