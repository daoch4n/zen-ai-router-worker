      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: Medium**\n\nThe `selectRandomGoogleApiKey` function, marked as deprecated, specifically filters for API keys matching the pattern `^KEY\\d+$`. In contrast, the new `selectGoogleApiKeyRoundRobin` function (which is the preferred alternative) uses `getGoogleApiKeysFromEnv`, which filters for keys starting with `KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.\n\nThis creates an inconsistency in how 'Google API keys' are identified across the old and new key selection strategies. If the intent is to consolidate all Google API key handling under the new round-robin approach, consider unifying the key identification logic. For example, `selectRandomGoogleApiKey` could also use `getGoogleApiKeysFromEnv` to ensure it considers all configured Google API keys, even if it's deprecated. Alternatively, if the `KEYn` specific filtering is a deliberate design choice for this deprecated function, it would be beneficial to document the reason for this distinction.",

This ensures that if the constant changes in the source file, this test automatically uses the correct value, preventing potential discrepancies or outdated tests.",

While the test for `characterCount` is good, it's crucial to add a test case for `splittingPreference: 'none'` where the `text` exceeds `MAX_TEXT_LENGTH_CHAR_COUNT`. In this scenario, the entire text should be treated as a single unit, and if it's too long, it should also result in an `HttpError` (likely with status 400).",
