However, `PASS=test_pass` is still present in `.dev.vars`. Storing sensitive credentials like passwords directly in `.dev.vars` is a security risk if this file is committed or shared. Please ensure this variable is moved to a `.env` file that is properly git-ignored, as per the previous resolution.",

Hardcoding API keys or other secrets directly in `.dev.vars` is a security vulnerability. These should be managed securely, ideally loaded from a secure source or set as environment variables outside of version control. Please move this to a git-ignored `.env` file.",
