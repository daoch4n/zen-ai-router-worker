While `errorHandler` is now imported and `env` is passed to `transformAnthropicToOpenAIRequest`, the provided diff does not show the actual implementation of this error detection and transformation logic within `handleAnthropicCompletions` after the call to the core OpenAI completions handler. Without this explicit check and transformation, upstream Gemini errors might still not be correctly propagated to the client in the expected Anthropic format.",

This is a significant improvement for maintainability and flexibility, allowing model mappings to be updated without code changes. Great job addressing this point!",
