While necessary for the DO to perform text splitting, this introduces code duplication. Consider creating a shared utility module that can be imported by both the orchestrator and the Durable Object, if feasible within the Workers environment, to improve maintainability and ensure consistency in text processing logic.",

If some sentences have failed, the job's overall status might be `processing_with_errors`. This method should still allow marking individual sentences as `completed` even if the job is in a `processing_with_errors` state. Consider allowing `processing_with_errors` as a valid status for this operation, e.g., `if (jobData.status !== 'processing' && jobData.status !== 'processing_with_errors')`.",

      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: High**\n\nIn `updateJobStatus`, if `sentenceIndexToFail` is provided and a sentence is marked as `failed`, the logic correctly attempts to set the overall job status to `processing_with_errors` or `completed_with_errors`. However, the subsequent `if (status) { jobData.status = status; }` allows an external caller to explicitly set the job status (e.g., to `processing`) even if there are failed chunks. This could lead to an inconsistent state where the job is marked `processing` but has underlying failed chunks. It's recommended to ensure that if `jobData.processedAudioChunks` contains any `failed` statuses, the overall `jobData.status` reflects this (e.g., `processing_with_errors` or `completed_with_errors`), unless the provided `status` is itself a more terminal failure state (like `failed` or `completed_with_errors`).",

      "comment_text_md": "**My Confidence: High**\n\nThe `apiKeyIndex` variable is declared as a global `let` variable. In a Cloudflare Worker environment, global variables are not guaranteed to persist across different incoming requests or even across different worker instances. This means the round-robin logic for API key selection will likely reset `apiKeyIndex` to `0` for each new request, effectively always picking the first API key in the list.\n\nTo ensure the round-robin selection works correctly and persists across requests, `apiKeyIndex` needs to be stored in a persistent state mechanism. Consider using a Cloudflare Durable Object (perhaps the `TtsJobDurableObject` itself if it's always involved, or a dedicated DO for worker state) or a Cloudflare KV namespace to store and retrieve this index.\n\nExample (using KV for simplicity, though a DO might be better for high-frequency updates):\n\n```javascript\n// In fetch(request, env)\nconst API_KEY_INDEX_KEY = 'tts_api_key_index';\nlet currentApiKeyIndex = 0;\n\n// Try to load the index from KV\ntry {\n  const storedIndex = await env.KV_NAMESPACE.get(API_KEY_INDEX_KEY);\n  if (storedIndex !== null) {\n    currentApiKeyIndex = parseInt(storedIndex, 10);\n  }\n} catch (e) {\n  console.error('Failed to load API key index from KV:', e);\n  // Fallback to 0 if KV fails\n}\n\n// ... inside the TTS API key selection logic ...\nselectedApiKey = apiKeys[currentApiKeyIndex % apiKeys.length];\ncurrentApiKeyIndex = (currentApiKeyIndex + 1) % apiKeys.length;\n\n// Store the updated index back to KV\ntry {\n  await env.KV_NAMESPACE.put(API_KEY_INDEX_KEY, currentApiKeyIndex.toString());\n} catch (e) {\n  console.error('Failed to save API key index to KV:', e);\n}\n```\n\nRemember to bind a KV namespace (e.g., `KV_NAMESPACE`) in your `wrangler.toml` if you choose this approach.",
