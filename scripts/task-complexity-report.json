      "taskTitle": "Implement POST /tts Endpoint and handleTTS Handler",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the `POST /tts` endpoint into file creation, routing configuration in `src/worker.mjs`, and initial `handleTTS` function structure in `src/handlers/tts.mjs`.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves basic file creation and routing setup, which is a straightforward and common development pattern with minimal logical complexity."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate Existing Authentication and Centralized Error Handling",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for integrating `getRandomApiKey` for authentication, wrapping the core `handleTTS` logic with a `try-catch` block, utilizing the `errorHandler` for exceptions, and ensuring `Content-Type: application/json` for error responses.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires understanding and correctly integrating existing utility functions and error handling patterns, which can be tricky to get right across all error paths and ensure consistent responses."
    },

      "taskTitle": "Parse Request Body and Query Parameters",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps for parsing `voiceName` and `secondVoiceName` from query parameters, `text` and `model` from the JSON request body, implementing validation for all required fields, and handling validation failures using the `errorHandler`.",
      "reasoning": "Parsing multiple types of input (query and body) combined with robust validation for required fields and proper error handling paths adds a layer of complexity beyond simple parsing."

      "taskTitle": "Develop WAV Audio Utility Functions",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the development of WAV audio utilities into creating `src/utils/audio.mjs`, implementing `decodeBase64Audio`, and detailing the byte-level construction of `generateWavHeader` using `DataView` for RIFF, WAVE, fmt, and data chunks, including unit tests for both functions.",
      "reasoning": "The `generateWavHeader` function requires precise, low-level byte manipulation and a deep understanding of the WAV file format specification, making it technically challenging. `decodeBase64Audio` is simpler but still a distinct utility."

      "taskTitle": "Construct Google Generative AI TTS Request Body (Single Speaker)",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the construction of the Google Generative AI TTS request body, specifying how parsed `text`, `voiceName`, and `model` are mapped to the API's `contents`, `generationConfig`, and `speechConfig` JSON structure, ensuring `multiSpeakerVoiceConfig` is omitted when `secondVoiceName` is not present.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves accurately mapping parsed input data into a specific, nested JSON structure required by an external API, which demands careful attention to detail and adherence to the API's schema."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Execute Google Generative AI API Call and Extract Audio Data",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the execution of the Google Generative AI API call into formulating the full endpoint URL, performing the `fetch` request with the constructed body, handling potential network and non-200 API responses, parsing the successful JSON response, extracting the base64 audio data and `mimeType`, and parsing the `sampleRate` from the `mimeType` string.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves interacting with an external API, which introduces complexities like network errors, API-specific error handling, and parsing potentially complex nested JSON responses, including string manipulation for `sampleRate`."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Assemble WAV File and Return Binary Audio Response",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps for assembling the final WAV file: decoding the base64 audio data using `decodeBase64Audio`, determining the `dataLength`, generating the WAV header using `generateWavHeader`, concatenating the header and PCM data into a single binary array, and constructing the final `Response` object with `Content-Type: audio/wav`.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines the results of previous steps, requiring careful handling and concatenation of binary data (`Uint8Array`s) and precise setting of response headers, which can be error-prone if not handled correctly."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Robust Error Handling and Input Validation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the refinement of error handling, including mapping common Google API error codes/messages to user-friendly worker responses, implementing specific validation for `voiceName` and `text` length, and reviewing all `try-catch` blocks to ensure consistent utilization of the `errorHandler`.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on making the system resilient and user-friendly in failure scenarios. It requires anticipating various error conditions, implementing comprehensive validation, and ensuring consistent error propagation, which can be complex and iterative."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the performance optimization task into identifying potential bottlenecks in audio processing and data manipulation, setting up and utilizing Cloudflare Worker's profiling tools or `console.time`/`console.timeEnd`, analyzing profiling results to pinpoint high-CPU operations, and implementing specific refactorings to meet the 10ms CPU target.",
      "reasoning": "Performance optimization is inherently complex, requiring specialized tools, deep understanding of execution flow, and often iterative refactoring to achieve specific targets. Identifying and resolving bottlenecks can be challenging."
