# Task ID: 2
# Title: Identify TypeScript and Configuration Files
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Confirm the presence and content of all `.ts` files and relevant configuration files to understand their current TypeScript dependencies.
# Details:
Use `find . -name "*.ts"` to confirm `orchestrator/src/index.ts`. Review the content of `tsconfig.json`, `orchestrator/wrangler.toml`, `package.json`, `jest.config.mjs`, and `.github/workflows/cf-deploy.yml`.

# Test Strategy:
Document the paths and initial content of all identified files. Ensure `orchestrator/src/index.ts` is confirmed as the primary file to be converted.
