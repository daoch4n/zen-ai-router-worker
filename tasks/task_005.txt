# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement State Retrieval in Request Transformation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the `requestAnthropic.mjs` transformation logic to retrieve the original `tool_name` from the `ConversationStateDO` using the provided `tool_use_id` in incoming `tool_result` blocks.
# Details:
1. Locate the `requestAnthropic.mjs` module or equivalent request transformation logic.
2. When processing an incoming Anthropic client request containing a `tool_result` block, extract the `tool_use_id`.
3. Make an internal `fetch` call to the `ConversationStateDO` stub's `/retrieve` endpoint, passing the `tool_use_id` (FR4.1).
   ```javascript
   // Inside request transformation logic
   const toolUseId = getToolUseIdFromAnthropicToolResult();
   const response = await conversationStateDOStub.fetch(`/retrieve?tool_use_id=${toolUseId}`);
   if (response.ok) {
     const { tool_name } = await response.json();
     // Use tool_name to populate the 'name' field for the downstream model
   } else {
     // Handle retrieval failure as per FR5.3
   }
   ```
4. If `tool_name` is successfully retrieved, use it to populate the `name` field in the message sent to the downstream model (e.g., OpenAI function message).

# Test Strategy:
Perform a multi-turn conversation: 1) Send a request that triggers a tool call (Task 4). 2) Send a subsequent request with the `tool_result` block containing the `tool_use_id`. Verify that the proxy correctly transforms the `tool_result` into the downstream model's format, using the original `tool_name` retrieved from the DO. Simulate `tool_use_id` not found to test error path.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Parse Incoming `tool_result` Blocks and Extract `tool_use_id` [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and parse `tool_result` blocks within the incoming request payload. Extract the `tool_use_id` from each relevant block to prepare for state retrieval.
### Details:
Focus on robust parsing, handling potential variations in `tool_result` block structure and ensuring all necessary `tool_use_id`s are captured.

## 2. Initiate Internal `fetch` Call to `ConversationStateDO` [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Construct and execute an internal `fetch` request to the `ConversationStateDO`'s `/retrieve` endpoint, using the extracted `tool_use_id` as a parameter to fetch associated state.
### Details:
Ensure correct endpoint URL, request method (e.g., GET), and proper parameter formatting for the `tool_use_id` in the fetch call.

## 3. Process `ConversationStateDO` Response and Extract `tool_name` [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Parse the JSON response received from the `ConversationStateDO`. Validate the response structure and reliably extract the `tool_name` associated with the `tool_use_id`.
### Details:
Implement validation for the DO response schema and handle cases of missing fields or malformed data to ensure `tool_name` is correctly extracted.

## 4. Transform Request with Retrieved `tool_name` [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Modify the original incoming request payload by incorporating the retrieved `tool_name` into the appropriate structure for the downstream model, completing the request transformation.
### Details:
Define the exact transformation logic and identify the target field(s) where the `tool_name` should be inserted or used within the downstream model's request format.

## 5. Implement Robust Error Handling and Logging for State Retrieval [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Add comprehensive error handling mechanisms for all steps of the state retrieval and transformation process, including parsing failures, network issues during `fetch` calls, and invalid DO responses. Implement logging for critical events and errors.
### Details:
Define specific error codes/messages, consider retry logic for transient failures, and establish clear logging levels for debugging and monitoring the state retrieval pipeline.
