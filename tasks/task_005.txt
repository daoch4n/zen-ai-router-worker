# Task ID: 5
# Title: Refactor orchestrator/src/index.mjs - Convert Interfaces and Types
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Convert `interface` and `type` declarations in `orchestrator/src/index.mjs` to JSDoc `@typedef` comments for documentation purposes, or replace with runtime checks if their definitions were used for critical runtime validation.
# Details:
For interfaces defining object shapes, convert them to JSDoc `@typedef` comments. Example: `interface MyType { prop: string; }` becomes `/** @typedef {{prop: string}} MyType */`. If runtime validation was dependent on these, implement a suitable JavaScript validation library (e.g., Joi) or manual checks.

# Test Strategy:
Code review `orchestrator/src/index.mjs` to ensure all `interface` and `type` declarations are removed and replaced with appropriate JSDoc or runtime checks. Verify that the intended structural documentation or validation is preserved.
