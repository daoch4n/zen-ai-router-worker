# Task ID: 5
# Title: Configure Orchestrator Worker `wrangler.toml`
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the basic `wrangler.toml` for the orchestrator worker, omitting explicit service bindings.
# Details:
Create `orchestrator-worker/wrangler.toml` with the following content:
```toml
# orchestrator-worker/wrangler.toml
name = "router-orchestrator"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-05-01"

# Service bindings will be dynamically added via GitHub Actions workflow.
# No explicit [[services]] block needed here for backend workers.
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify the `wrangler.toml` file exists in the `orchestrator-worker` directory and contains the specified configuration. Attempt to run `wrangler dev` from this directory to check for basic syntax validity.
