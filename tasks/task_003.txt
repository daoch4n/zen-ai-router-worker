# Title: Rename orchestrator/src/index.ts to .mjs
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Rename the primary orchestrator worker entry point from `orchestrator/src/index.ts` to `orchestrator/src/index.mjs`.
# Details:
Execute `git mv orchestrator/src/index.ts orchestrator/src/index.mjs` to rename the file while preserving its Git history.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that `orchestrator/src/index.ts` no longer exists and `orchestrator/src/index.mjs` is present in its place. Confirm the file content remains intact.
