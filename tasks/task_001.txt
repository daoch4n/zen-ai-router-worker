# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create Dedicated Git Branch for Refactoring
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Isolate all refactoring changes in a new, dedicated Git branch to ensure the main branch remains untouched and stable.
# Details:
Execute `git checkout -b feature/ts-to-js-refactor` to create and switch to the new branch.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that a new branch named `feature/ts-to-js-refactor` has been created and that the current working branch is set to it using `git branch` and `git status`.
