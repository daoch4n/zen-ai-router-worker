# Task ID: 1
# Title: Cloudflare Worker and Durable Object Project Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Cloudflare Worker project, configure it to use Durable Objects, and define the necessary bindings for the ConversationStateDO. This sets up the foundational environment for state management.
# Details:
1. Initialize a new Cloudflare Worker project using `wrangler init`.
2. Configure `wrangler.toml` to define a Durable Object binding, e.g., `[[durable_objects.bindings]] name = "CONVERSATION_STATE" class_name = "ConversationStateDO"`.
3. Create placeholder files for the main Worker (`src/index.js` or `src/worker.js`) and the Durable Object (`src/ConversationStateDO.js`).
4. Ensure the Worker can access the DO environment variable `env.CONVERSATION_STATE`.

# Test Strategy:
Deploy a minimal Worker and DO. Verify that the Worker can successfully obtain a DO stub using `env.CONVERSATION_STATE.idFromName('test')` without errors. Check Cloudflare dashboard for DO binding configuration.
