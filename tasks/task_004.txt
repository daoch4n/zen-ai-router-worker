# Task ID: 4
# Title: Construct Raw Audio Response Body for `/rawtts`
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Set the HTTP response body to the `base64Audio` string received directly from Google's API, without any decoding or WAV conversion.
# Details:
Create a new `Response` object with the `base64Audio` string as its body: `new Response(base64Audio, { /* ...headers... */ });`. Explicitly ensure that the `decodeBase64Audio` and `generateWavHeader` functions, used by the `/tts` endpoint, are *not* called for `/rawtts`.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test `handleRawTTS` (with mocked Google API) to assert that the returned `Response` object's body is identical to the `base64Audio` string provided by the mock, and that no WAV-related processing occurs.
