# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement State Persistence in Response Transformation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the `responseAnthropic.mjs` transformation logic to extract `tool_use_id` and `tool_name` from downstream model responses and persist them in the `ConversationStateDO`.
# Details:
1. Locate the `responseAnthropic.mjs` module or equivalent response transformation logic.
2. When processing a downstream model's response that contains tool/function calls, iterate through each identified tool call.
3. For each tool call, extract or generate a `tool_use_id` and identify the `tool_name`.
4. Make an internal `fetch` call to the `ConversationStateDO` stub's `/store` endpoint, passing the `tool_use_id` and `tool_name` (FR3.1).
   ```javascript
   // Inside response transformation logic
   const toolUseId = generateUniqueToolUseId(); // Or extract from downstream model if applicable
   const toolName = getToolNameFromDownstreamResponse();
   await conversationStateDOStub.fetch('/store', {
     method: 'POST',
     body: JSON.stringify({ tool_use_id: toolUseId, tool_name: toolName }),
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
   });
   // Construct Anthropic tool_use block with toolUseId
   ```

# Test Strategy:
Send a request that triggers a tool call from the downstream model. Intercept the response from the proxy and verify that the Anthropic `tool_use` block contains a `tool_use_id`. Query the `ConversationStateDO` directly (e.g., via a test endpoint or logs) to confirm the `tool_use_id` to `tool_name` mapping was successfully stored.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Parse Anthropic Response for Tool Calls [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine the Anthropic model's response (e.g., `tool_use` blocks within `content` array) to identify if any tool calls were made. This involves iterating through the response structure.
### Details:
Check for `type: 'tool_use'` in the `content` array of the Anthropic response. If found, proceed to extract details.

## 2. Extract Tool Call Data [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: For each identified tool call, extract the `tool_name` and the `input` arguments (parameters) required for the tool's execution.
### Details:
Access `tool_use.name` and `tool_use.input` from the parsed tool_use block. Ensure proper handling of different input types (e.g., JSON objects).

## 3. Generate Unique `tool_use_id` [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Generate a unique identifier for each tool call instance. This ID will be used for tracking the tool call's state within the `ConversationStateDO`.
### Details:
Utilize a robust method for ID generation (e.g., UUID v4) to ensure uniqueness across multiple tool calls and conversations.

## 4. Prepare Payload and Make Internal `fetch` Call to ConversationStateDO [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Construct the payload containing the extracted tool data and the generated `tool_use_id`. Then, make an internal `fetch` call to the `ConversationStateDO`'s `/store` endpoint to persist this information.
### Details:
The payload should include `tool_name`, `input`, and `tool_use_id`. The `fetch` call should target the `ConversationStateDO` instance associated with the current conversation.

## 5. Handle `fetch` Call Response and Errors [done]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Process the response from the `ConversationStateDO`'s `/store` endpoint. This includes confirming successful storage or handling any errors that occurred during the internal `fetch` call.
### Details:
Check the HTTP status code and response body from the DO. Implement error logging and appropriate fallback mechanisms if the storage fails.
