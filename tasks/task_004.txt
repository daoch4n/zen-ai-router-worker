# Task ID: 4
# Title: Configure `backend-worker-template/wrangler.toml`
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the basic `wrangler.toml` for the backend worker template.
# Details:
Create `backend-worker-template/wrangler.toml` with the following content:
```toml
# backend-worker-template/wrangler.toml
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-05-01"
# No 'name' field here, as it's set dynamically by the CI/CD.
# No [[services]] bindings needed here as they are the target of RPC calls.
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify the `wrangler.toml` file exists in the `backend-worker-template` directory and contains the specified configuration. Attempt to run `wrangler dev` from this directory to check for basic syntax validity.
