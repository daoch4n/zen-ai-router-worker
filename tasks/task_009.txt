# Task ID: 9
# Title: Optimize Worker Performance and Profile CPU Usage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Review the implementation for potential performance bottlenecks, especially in audio manipulation (base64 decoding, WAV header generation, concatenation). Profile the worker's CPU usage to ensure it remains under the 10ms target (excluding external API call time).
# Details:
1. Ensure `decodeBase64Audio` and `generateWavHeader` are as efficient as possible.
2. Minimize intermediate data structures or unnecessary copying.
3. Use Cloudflare Worker's built-in profiling tools or `console.time`/`console.timeEnd` to measure execution time of critical sections.
4. Identify and refactor any high-CPU operations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run performance tests with various text lengths and concurrent requests.
2. Monitor Cloudflare Worker logs and metrics for CPU time per request.
3. Ensure the worker-side processing time consistently stays below 10ms.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initial Bottleneck Identification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct a preliminary analysis of the audio processing and data manipulation logic to hypothesize potential areas of high CPU usage or inefficient operations.
### Details:
Focus on complex algorithms, large data structures, frequent iterations, or synchronous/blocking I/O operations that might be contributing to performance issues.

## 2. Implement Performance Profiling [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Set up and utilize Cloudflare Worker's profiling tools or strategically place `console.time`/`console.timeEnd` markers within the code to measure execution times of identified or suspected bottleneck areas.
### Details:
Ensure profiling covers critical paths related to audio processing and data manipulation. Collect sufficient data for meaningful analysis under typical load conditions.

## 3. Analyze Profiling Results [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Review the collected profiling data to accurately pinpoint specific functions, loops, or operations that are consuming the most CPU time and contributing significantly to the overall execution duration.
### Details:
Prioritize operations that exceed acceptable thresholds or contribute disproportionately to the total execution time. Identify the root causes of high CPU usage.

## 4. Implement Optimizations and Verify Target [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Apply targeted code refactorings and optimizations based on the profiling analysis to reduce CPU usage, aiming to meet the 10ms CPU target for audio processing and data manipulation.
### Details:
This may involve algorithm optimization, data structure changes, reducing redundant computations, or leveraging more efficient built-in functions. Re-profile after changes to verify the target is met.
