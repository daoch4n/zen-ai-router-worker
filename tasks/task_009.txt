# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Monitoring and Logging
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate monitoring and logging capabilities to track `ConversationStateDO` performance, usage, and error rates, providing visibility into the state management layer.
# Details:
1. **DO Metrics (NFR7):** Utilize Cloudflare Workers' built-in metrics (e.g., `context.waitUntil` for async operations, `console.log` for custom metrics that can be parsed by a logging solution) to track:
    *   `ConversationStateDO` request counts (store, retrieve, delete, clear).
    *   Latency of DO operations.
    *   Storage metrics (e.g., number of keys, total storage size).
    *   Number of active DO instances.
    *   Cleanup operations triggered by alarms or explicit API.
2. **Error Rates (NFR7):** Log all errors related to DO operations and tool name mapping failures, including retry attempts and final outcomes. Categorize errors for easier analysis.
3. Integrate with existing logging infrastructure (e.g., Cloudflare Logpush to an external sink) to centralize logs.
4. Set up basic alerts for high error rates or unexpected DO behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Perform various test scenarios (successful, error, cleanup). Verify that relevant metrics are emitted and logs are generated for each operation. Check Cloudflare dashboard for DO metrics. Confirm that error conditions trigger appropriate log entries and potential alerts.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify Key Durable Object Metrics [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and document the essential metrics for Durable Object operations (e.g., invocations, latency, errors) and state (e.g., memory usage, storage operations, active instances).
### Details:
Collaborate with development and operations teams to list critical performance indicators and health metrics for Durable Objects.

## 2. Implement Custom Metrics via console.log [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Integrate custom logging within Cloudflare Workers using `console.log` to emit identified key metrics (e.g., DO invocation counts, specific error types) in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
### Details:
Modify Worker code to emit structured logs for each identified metric, ensuring they are easily parseable by log aggregation systems.

## 3. Implement Asynchronous Metric Reporting with context.waitUntil [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Utilize `context.waitUntil` in Cloudflare Workers to send non-blocking, asynchronous metric data (e.g., to an external analytics service or for more complex custom metrics) without delaying the main response.
### Details:
Develop helper functions or modules to push metrics asynchronously using `context.waitUntil` for operations that don't need to block the main request path.

## 4. Configure Cloudflare Logpush for Observability [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Set up Cloudflare Logpush to forward Worker logs (including custom `console.log` metrics) to a chosen log aggregation and analysis platform (e.g., S3, Google Cloud Storage, Splunk, Datadog).
### Details:
Access Cloudflare dashboard, configure Logpush job, select appropriate log fields, and verify data ingestion into the target platform.

## 5. Define Initial Alert Conditions for High Error Rates [done]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Establish baseline alert conditions for high error rates detected in Durable Object operations, leveraging the ingested logs and metrics.
### Details:
Configure alerts in the chosen log analysis platform for thresholds like '5xx error rate > X% over Y minutes' or 'specific DO error count > Z over T period'.

## 6. Define Initial Alert Conditions for Unusual DO Behavior [done]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Set up initial alert conditions for unusual or anomalous Durable Object behavior, such as unexpected latency spikes, unusual invocation patterns, or excessive resource consumption.
### Details:
Configure alerts for deviations from normal operational patterns, e.g., 'DO latency > X ms for Y minutes' or 'DO storage operations spike by Z%'.
