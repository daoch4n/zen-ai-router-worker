# Task ID: 8
# Title: Remove import type Statements
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Remove all `import type { ... } from '...';` statements from the entire codebase, as they are TypeScript-specific and no longer needed.
# Details:
Perform a project-wide search and remove all instances of `import type` statements.

# Test Strategy:
Code review the entire project to ensure no `import type` statements remain. Verify that the removal does not introduce any runtime errors.
