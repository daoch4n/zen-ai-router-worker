# Task ID: 8
# Title: Update Routing for `/rawtts` in `src/worker.mjs`
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Add a new case to the `switch` statement in the `fetch` function of `src/worker.mjs` to route POST requests for paths ending with `/rawtts` to the `handleRawTTS` handler.
# Details:
In `src/worker.mjs`, locate the `fetch` function and its `switch` statement that handles different API paths. Add a new `case` for `/rawtts` that checks `request.method === 'POST'` and calls `return handleRawTTS(request, env.GOOGLE_API_KEY);`.

# Test Strategy:
Deploy the Cloudflare Worker to a staging environment. Send a POST request to the `/rawtts` endpoint with valid parameters. Verify that the request is successfully routed to `handleRawTTS` and returns the expected raw audio response. Also, test with incorrect methods (e.g., GET) to ensure it's not routed.
