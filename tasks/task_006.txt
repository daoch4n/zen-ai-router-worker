# Task ID: 6
# Title: Refactor orchestrator/src/index.mjs - Convert Enums
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Convert TypeScript `enum` declarations in `orchestrator/src/index.mjs` to plain JavaScript objects with `const` declarations, maintaining their functional equivalent.
# Details:
Example: `enum Status { Active, Inactive }` should be converted to `const Status = { Active: 'Active', Inactive: 'Inactive' };` or `const Status = Object.freeze({ Active: 'Active', Inactive: 'Inactive' });` for immutability.

# Test Strategy:
Code review `orchestrator/src/index.mjs` to confirm all `enum` declarations are replaced by plain JavaScript objects. Verify that references to enum members (e.g., `Status.Active`) are correctly updated and function as expected.
