# Task ID: 15
# Title: Local Development Server Verification
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Start both the orchestrator and backend Cloudflare Workers locally and manually test all critical API endpoints exposed by both workers to ensure they function as expected and return correct responses.
# Details:
Execute `flatpak-spawn --host wrangler dev` for both the orchestrator and any backend workers. Use tools like `curl` or a browser to manually hit all critical API endpoints and verify their responses.

# Test Strategy:
Document the successful responses and expected behavior for each critical API endpoint tested locally. Ensure no errors are reported by `wrangler dev`.
