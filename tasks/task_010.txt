# Task ID: 10
# Title: Comprehensive Testing and Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of all implemented features, including functional, non-functional, and integration tests. Update documentation and prepare the solution for deployment.
# Details:
1. **Unit Tests:** Ensure all individual components (`ConversationStateDO` methods, transformation functions, error handlers) have thorough unit tests.
2. **Integration Tests:** Develop end-to-end integration tests covering multi-turn tool-based conversations, including:
    *   Successful tool call -> tool result flow.
    *   External tool failure handling.
    *   Malformed client `tool_result` handling.
    *   DO storage/retrieval failures and retries.
    *   Inactivity-based DO cleanup.
    *   Explicit conversation termination.
3. **Performance Testing (NFR1):** Measure latency added by DO interactions (P95 < 50ms).
4. **Scalability Testing (NFR2):** Simulate high concurrent conversations to ensure the solution scales.
5. **Security Review (NFR5):** Verify `conversationId` isolation.
6. **Documentation:** Update the API documentation to reflect the new `X-Conversation-ID` header and the `/v1/conversations/{conversationId}/terminate` endpoint. Document internal architecture and deployment steps.
7. **Release Criteria (MVP):** Verify all MVP criteria (FR1-FR5, FR6.1-FR6.3, NFR1-NFR5, SM1-SM3) are met.

# Test Strategy:
Execute the full suite of unit and integration tests. Analyze test results against success metrics (SM1, SM2, SM3). Conduct load testing to validate NFRs. Review updated documentation for accuracy and completeness. Obtain sign-off from relevant stakeholders.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Unit Testing Execution & Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Execute all defined unit tests for individual code components and modules to ensure their isolated functionality. Review test results and address any failures.
### Details:
Success Criteria: All critical and high-priority unit tests pass; code coverage meets or exceeds the defined threshold (e.g., >80%); no new regressions are introduced at the component level.

## 2. Integration Test Plan & Scenario Definition [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop comprehensive test plans and detailed scenarios for integration testing, covering all core user flows, system interactions, and anticipated error conditions.
### Details:
Success Criteria: Detailed test cases are documented for all core flows and error paths; necessary test data is prepared and validated; clear expected outcomes are defined for each scenario.

## 3. Core Flow Integration Testing Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Execute integration tests for all primary user journeys and core functionalities to ensure seamless interaction between integrated components.
### Details:
Success Criteria: All core flow integration tests pass; the system behaves as expected across integrated components; no critical or high-severity defects are found in main workflows.

## 4. Error Scenario Integration Testing Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Execute integration tests specifically designed to validate error handling, edge cases, and negative scenarios to ensure system robustness.
### Details:
Success Criteria: The system gracefully handles all defined error conditions; appropriate and informative error messages are displayed; no data corruption or system crashes occur on invalid inputs or unexpected scenarios.

## 5. Performance & Scalability Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Conduct load, stress, and endurance tests to assess system performance under various loads, identify scalability bottlenecks, and ensure responsiveness.
### Details:
Success Criteria: The system meets defined performance SLAs (e.g., response times, throughput, concurrent users); system scales effectively under increased load; resource utilization remains within acceptable limits; no significant performance degradation over extended periods.

## 6. Security Review & Penetration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Perform a comprehensive security review, including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and code review for common security flaws and adherence to best practices.
### Details:
Success Criteria: All identified critical and high-severity vulnerabilities are remediated; no new security vulnerabilities are introduced; the system adheres to defined security policies and compliance requirements.

## 7. API & Internal Architecture Documentation Update [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Update and review API documentation (endpoints, request/response formats, authentication) and internal architecture diagrams/descriptions to reflect the current, tested state of the system.
### Details:
Success Criteria: API documentation is accurate, complete, and easy to understand for developers; internal architecture documentation clearly depicts system components, interactions, and data flows; all documentation changes are version-controlled and approved.

## 8. Deployment Guide Documentation Update [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Update and review the deployment guide, including prerequisites, installation steps, configuration, and troubleshooting for production environments, ensuring it reflects the final tested configuration.
### Details:
Success Criteria: The deployment guide is accurate, complete, and enables successful, repeatable deployment by operations teams; all necessary configuration parameters are documented; troubleshooting steps are clear and actionable; guide is version-controlled and approved.
