# Task ID: 10
# Title: Update API Documentation for `/rawtts` Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Clearly document the new `/rawtts` endpoint, specifying its request parameters, the base64 encoded response body, and the `Content-Type` header's meaning. Provide examples for client-side consumption.
# Details:
Update the existing API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI specification, Markdown documentation) to include:
- **Endpoint:** `POST /rawtts`
- **Request Parameters:** Detail the JSON body (`text`, `model`) and query parameters (`voiceName`, `secondVoiceName`).
- **Response Body:** Explicitly state that the response body is a plain text base64 encoded audio string.
- **Response Headers:** Explain that the `Content-Type` header (e.g., `audio/L16;rate=24000`, `audio/ogg; codecs=opus`) indicates the format of the *encoded* audio data.
- **Client-Side Handling:** Provide clear instructions and code examples (e.g., in JavaScript, Python) on how clients should base64 decode the response body and interpret it using the `Content-Type` header.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct a thorough manual review of the updated API documentation. Ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness. Verify that all key aspects of the `/rawtts` endpoint's behavior, especially the raw base64 response and `Content-Type` header, are unambiguously explained for developers.
