# Task ID: 10
# Title: Document Endpoint Usage and Conduct Integration Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Create basic internal documentation for developers on how to use the new `/tts` endpoint, including example requests and expected responses. Conduct end-to-end integration tests to ensure the entire flow works as expected.
# Details:
1. Document the `POST /tts` endpoint, required headers, query parameters, and request body format.
2. Provide `curl` examples for single-speaker audio generation.
3. Note any known limitations or future enhancements.
4. Perform manual or automated integration tests covering successful single-speaker generation, various valid inputs, and common error scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
1. Follow the documented examples to make requests and verify successful audio generation.
2. Verify that error responses match the documented format.
3. Ensure the documentation is clear, accurate, and easy to understand for a developer persona.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document `POST /tts` Endpoint Overview and Authentication [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Outline the purpose of the `POST /tts` endpoint, its base URL, and specify any required authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, tokens) and their placement (e.g., `Authorization` header).
### Details:
This subtask focuses on setting up the foundational documentation for the endpoint, including its general function and how users authenticate to access it.

## 2. Detail `POST /tts` Required Headers, Query Parameters, and Request Body [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Document all required and optional HTTP headers, query parameters (if any), and the exact JSON schema or format for the request body. Include data types, constraints, and example values for each field within the request body.
### Details:
This subtask delves into the specifics of the request structure, ensuring all input parameters are clearly defined for developers.

## 3. Generate `curl` Examples for `POST /tts` Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create multiple `curl` command examples demonstrating successful requests with various valid inputs (e.g., different text lengths, voice options, output formats) and common error scenarios, for inclusion in the documentation.
### Details:
This subtask provides practical, runnable examples that developers can use to quickly understand and interact with the endpoint.

## 4. Plan End-to-End Integration Test Scenarios for `POST /tts` [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Define a comprehensive set of end-to-end integration test scenarios. This includes successful audio generation (various valid inputs), edge cases (e.g., very long/short text, specific characters), and common error scenarios (e.g., missing required fields, invalid data types, unauthorized access, rate limiting).
### Details:
This subtask focuses on the strategic planning of integration tests, ensuring broad coverage of functionality and potential issues.

## 5. Execute `POST /tts` Integration Tests and Document Results [done]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Execute the planned end-to-end integration tests against the `POST /tts` endpoint. Document the test results, including pass/fail status for each scenario, observed responses, and any identified bugs or discrepancies.
### Details:
This subtask involves the practical execution of the test plan and the systematic recording of outcomes to ensure the endpoint's reliability.
