# Task ID: 16
# Title: Execute Unit Test Suite
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Execute the existing unit test suite using `flatpak-spawn --host npm test` and verify that all tests pass without errors or failures. Update any tests that relied on TypeScript-specific constructs or import paths.
# Details:
Run `flatpak-spawn --host npm test`. Address any failing tests by updating them to reflect the `.mjs` changes and pure JavaScript syntax.

# Test Strategy:
All unit tests must pass successfully. Review test reports for any failures or unexpected behavior. Ensure test coverage is maintained.
