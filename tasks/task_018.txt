# Task ID: 18
# Title: Deploy to Staging Environment
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy the refactored workers to a non-production staging environment. The main worker has been successfully deployed, but the orchestrator worker deployment failed due to a service binding resolution error ('Could not resolve service binding 'BACKEND_SERVICE'. Target script 'zen-ai-router-worker' not found.').
# Details:
Initial deployment attempt resulted in the successful deployment of the main worker. However, the orchestrator worker deployment failed with the error: 'Could not resolve service binding 'BACKEND_SERVICE'. Target script 'zen-ai-router-worker' not found.' This suggests a potential timing issue where the main worker (zen-ai-router-worker) was not fully propagated or available before the orchestrator's deployment attempt. A retry of the orchestrator worker deployment is necessary after allowing sufficient propagation time for the main worker.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the main worker is accessible at its staging URL. Confirm that the retried orchestrator worker deployment completes successfully without errors. After successful deployment, verify that the orchestrator worker is accessible and correctly routing requests to the main worker.
