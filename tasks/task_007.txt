# Task ID: 7
# Title: Update Import/Export Paths to .mjs Extensions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform a project-wide search and replace to change `.ts` extensions to `.mjs` in all `import` and `export` statements referencing local files.
# Details:
This will affect imports within `orchestrator/src/index.mjs` and any other `.mjs` files that previously imported from `orchestrator/src/index.ts` or other local `.ts` files. Ensure all local file references explicitly use the `.mjs` extension (e.g., `import { func } from './module.mjs';`).

# Test Strategy:
Globally search the codebase for `.ts` extensions in `import` and `export` statements and verify they have been updated to `.mjs`. Confirm that all module resolutions are correct and no import errors occur.
