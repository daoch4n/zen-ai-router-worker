    // This interpretation might be confusing. A separate header for worker access might be better,
    // but for now, we'll assume if env.PASS is set, the client's key must match it
    // for general worker access, AND this key will also be used for downstream.
    // This doesn't quite align with "client-provided API key is for downstream service".
    // Re-evaluating based on prompt: "authenticateClientRequest to extract and return the client's API key"
    // "The googleApiKeyForBackend should only be used for Google-specific services"
    // This implies the client's key IS for downstream. The env.PASS check is a separate gate.

    // Let's adjust: The prompt implies authenticateClientRequest primarily extracts the client's key.
    // The worker-level auth (env.PASS) should be a separate check if needed, or done differently.
    // For now, let's assume env.PASS is for a different purpose or not the primary focus here.
    // The main goal is to get the CLIENT's key for downstream.

    // If env.PASS is set, let's assume it's a separate worker access password.
    // The client should provide THEIR OWN API key for the downstream service.
    // How to handle worker access then? The original code used the client's key to check against env.PASS.
    // This is a bit tangled.
    // Let's simplify: if env.PASS is set, the *client's provided key* must match it.
    // This means the client sends *their own downstream API key*, and if env.PASS is also set,
    // that *same key* must also match env.PASS. This is restrictive but matches original logic.
    // A better model would be two keys: one for worker access, one for downstream.
    // But sticking to modifying current structure:
    if (env.PASS && env.PASS.trim() !== "" && clientApiKey !== env.PASS) {
        // This interpretation means if PASS is set, the client's API key *must* be the PASS key.
        // This is likely not what's desired for using client's *own* OpenAI/Anthropic key.

        // Corrected interpretation: `env.PASS` is a general access token for the worker.
        // The `Authorization: Bearer <key>` is the *client's key for the downstream service*.
        // These are separate. The original `authenticateClientRequest` was checking if the Bearer token IS `env.PASS`.
        // This means the original setup used `env.PASS` as the *only* accepted Bearer token.

        // New logic:
        // 1. Extract client's API key (done: clientApiKey).
        // 2. If env.WORKER_ACCESS_KEY is set (new name for clarity, vs env.PASS),
        //    then a *separate* header like 'X-Worker-Access-Key' should be checked.
        //    Or, if we stick to ONE Bearer token, then the worker cannot have its own separate access key
        //    if the Bearer token is meant for downstream.

        // Sticking to the prompt: "extract and return the client's API key".
        // The `env.PASS` check in the original code was for general worker auth.
        // Let's keep that check but clarify its role. If `env.PASS` is set, client must provide it.
        // This means client sends `env.PASS` as Bearer to use worker, then worker uses its own keys for downstream.
        // This conflicts with "use the client-provided API key".

        // Final revised logic for authenticateClientRequest:
        // It's about the CLIENT'S key for downstream.
        // The `env.PASS` validation, if it remains, is a simple gatekeeper for the worker itself,
        // separate from the key that will be proxied.
        // The original code checked `token === env.PASS`. This means the client *had* to send `env.PASS`.
        // This is not compatible with "client-provided API key for downstream".

        // Resolution: Remove `env.PASS` check from this function.
        // This function's sole job is to extract the client's downstream key.
        // Worker-level access control (if `env.PASS` is for that) needs a different mechanism
        // if the Bearer token is now purely for downstream.
        // If `env.PASS` was *intended* to be the single API key for everything, that's what needs to change.

        // Assuming the goal is: Client sends their OpenAI/Anthropic key. Worker uses that.
        // `env.PASS` is irrelevant for this direct proxying of client's key.
    }
    // If `env.PASS` was for worker auth, and client also sends their own key,
    // they'd need two separate headers or a more complex auth scheme.
    // For this refactor, `authenticateClientRequest` will just get the client's key.
    // Any separate worker authorization using `env.PASS` would need to be handled distinctly,
    // possibly by a different function or an additional header check if `env.PASS` is present.

    // For now, let's assume `env.PASS` is NOT used if we are to use the client's key for downstream.
    // The original function's behavior implies `env.PASS` was the *only* allowed key.
    // This has to change to fulfill the request.
