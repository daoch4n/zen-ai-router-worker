// optimizeTextForJson has been moved to orchestrator/src/utils/textProcessing.mjs and is tested there.
// This file should now focus on testing functionalities specific to src/handlers/tts.mjs if any exist beyond the core fetch handler.

// If src/handlers/tts.mjs were to contain other exportable utility functions
// or if its main fetch handler needed unit testing independent of the orchestrator,
// those tests would go here. For now, since the text optimization is moved
// and the core fetch logic is primarily integration-tested via the orchestrator,
// this file might be empty or contain very specific tests.

// Example placeholder if more tests were needed for src/handlers/tts.mjs directly
